0,analysis of dns graph of phishing websites using digital certificates,Y. Ishida; M. Hanada; A. Waseda; M. W. Kim,2023 25th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT),2023,10.23919/ICACT56868.2023.10079566,"The prevalence of phishing threats has grown substantially over the past several years. Because phishing domains generally have a very short lifetime to avoid detection, they must be identified as soon as possible to prevent damage. In general, phishers frequently reassign resources, such as domain names and IP addresses, to avoid detection. Consequently, multiple domains may be hosted by the same IP address, or vice versa. Furthermore, phishing websites often employ certificates and HTTPS encryption to appear more trustworthy. In this study, we focused on HTTPS-enabled phishing websites to construct and analyze DNS graphs of domain names and IP addresses of phishing websites using Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. From the analysis results, we examined the differences between benign and phishing websites in terms of the number of nodes per component and average node degree."
1,discovering httpsified phishing websites using the tls certificates footprints,Y. Sakurai; T. Watanabe; T. Okuda; M. Akiyama; T. Mori,2020 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW),2020,10.1109/EuroSPW51379.2020.00077,"With the recent rise of HTTPS adoption on the Web, attackers have begun ""HTTPSifying"" phishing websites. HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include: (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites with low false positives and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs."
2,beyond the lock icon: real-time detection of phishing websites using public key certificates,Z. Dong; A. Kapadia; J. Blythe; L. J. Camp,2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime),2015,10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120795,"We propose a machine-learning approach to detect phishing websites using features from their X.509 public key certificates. We show that its efficacy extends beyond HTTPS-enabled sites. Our solution enables immediate local identification of phishing sites. As such, this serves as an important complement to the existing server-based anti-phishing mechanisms which predominately use blacklists. Blacklisting suffers from several inherent drawbacks in terms of correctness, timeliness, and completeness. Due to the potentially significant lag prior to site blacklisting, there is a window of opportunity for attackers. Other local client-side phishing detection approaches also exist, but primarily rely on page content or URLs, which are arguably easier to manipulate by attackers. We illustrate that our certificate-based approach greatly increases the difficulty of masquerading undetected for phishers, with single millisecond delays for users. We further show that this approach works not only against HTTPS-enabled phishing attacks, but also detects HTTP phishing attacks with port 443 enabled."
3,android malware detection scheme based on level of ssl server certificate,H. Kato; S. Haruta; I. Sasase,2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2019,10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013483,"Detecting Android malware is imperative. As a promising Android malware detection scheme, we focus on the scheme leveraging the differences of traffic patterns between benign apps and malware. Those differences can be captured even if the packet is encrypted. However, since such features are just statistic based ones, they cannot identify whether each traffic is malicious. Thus, it is necessary to design the scheme which is applicable to encrypted traffic data and supports identification of malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection scheme based on the level of SSL server certificate. Attackers tend to use an untrusted certificate to encrypt malicious payloads in many cases because passing rigorous examination is required to get a trusted certificate. Thus, we utilize SSL server certificate based features for detection since their certificates tend to be untrusted. Furthermore, in order to obtain the more exact features, we introduce required permission based weight values because malware inevitably require permissions regarding malicious actions. By computer simulation with real dataset, we show our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.7 %. True positive rate and false positive rate are 5.6% higher and 3.3% lower than the previous scheme, respectively. Our scheme can cope with encrypted malicious payloads and 89 malware which are not detected by the previous scheme."
4,detecting ambiguous phishing certificates using machine learning,S. Homayoun; K. Hageman; S. Afzal-Houshmand; C. D. Jensen; J. M. Pedersen,2022 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN),2022,10.1109/ICOIN53446.2022.9687264,"Recent phishing attacks have started to migrate to HTTP over TLS (HTTPS), making a phishing web page appear safe to the user’s browser despite its malicious purpose. This paper benefits from both digital certificates and domains related data features to propose machine learning-based solutions to predict digital certificates involved in HTTPS as phishing or benign certificates. In contrast to previous works that consider this a binary classification problem, we take into account that a certificate can be partially benign and phishy simultaneously. We propose a multi-class classifier and a regressor to classify these ambiguous certificates, in addition to benign and phishing certificates, where the ‘phishyness’ of a certificate is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 for the regressor. We apply our method to a set of certificates obtained from certificate transparency logs and show that we can classify them with high performance. We extend our validation by evaluating the performance of the model over time, showing that our model generalizes over time on our training data set."
5,a secure and efficient certificateless authentication scheme with unsupervised anomaly detection in vanets,H. Tan; Z. Gui; I. Chung,IEEE Access,2018,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883426,"As the crucial component of intelligent transportation system, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are capable of providing a variety of safety-related functionalities and commercial-oriented applications, which significantly improves the driving experience. Due to the foreseen impact of VANETs, extensive studies in both academia and industry fields has been made, which emphasizes on effective VANETs implementations. In practical VANETs scenarios with open wireless communication characteristics, enhanced security strategies should be deployed in order to guarantee transmission safety. Moreover, individual vehicle needs to perform pre-defined authentication process toward all the acquired messages, some of which may be generated by abnormal devices or malicious attackers. In this case, with large amounts of anomaly messages to be authenticated during a relatively short time period, the denial of service (DoS) attack is possible. Note that the vehicle has limited computation capability and restrained storage. In this paper, we address the above issues by developing a secure and efficient authentication scheme with unsupervised anomaly detection. In our design, certificateless authentication technique is deployed for conditional privacy preserving, along with the Chinese remainder theorem for efficient group key distribution and dynamic updating. Subsequently, the corresponding unsupervised anomaly detection method is illustrated, which applies dynamic time warping for distance measurement. The proposed method could remarkably alleviate unnecessary authentication burden in vehicle side. DoS attack can also be prevented in this way. Furthermore, anomaly detection method is conducted by the involving road side units (RSUs), while the contents of the processing traffic flows are kept secret to RSUs during the entire process. Security analysis shows that our scheme can achieve desired security properties. Additionally, performance analysis demonstrates that our design is efficient compared with state-of-the-art."
6,semi-ct: certificates transparent to identity owners but opaque to snoopers,A. Sun; B. Li; Q. Wang; H. Wan; J. Lin; W. Wang,2023 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),2023,10.1109/ISCC58397.2023.10217862,"Certificate Transparency (CT) enables timely detection of problematic certification authorities (CAs) by publicly recording all CA-issued certificates. This transparency inevitably leaks the privacy of identity owners (IdOs) through the identity information bound in certificates. In response to the privacy leakage, several privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed that transform/hash/encrypt the privacy-carrying part in certificates. However, these certificates conceal identity while also making it opaque to the IdO, which defeats the purpose of CT. To address the contradiction between transparency and privacy, we propose Semi-CT, a semi-transparency mechanism that makes the certificates transparent to IdOs but opaque to snoopers. Inspired by public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS), Semi-CT based on bilinear pairing enables trapdoor-holding IdOs to retrieve certificates associated with their identity. Semi-CT also addresses protocol deviation detection and trapdoor protection in the malicious model. Finally, through theoretical and experimental analysis, we prove the security and feasibility of Semi-CT for practical applications."

Data communication between two or more parties using certificate authentication is a frequently employed security assurance approach that creates a substantial quantity of certificate data traffic. In the process of utilizing conventional certificates, it is possible to leak sensitive information of the corporation. For example, certificate data traffic in the smart grid may expose important nodes and current security management level of a certain grid-related network. Therefore, a solution is required to evaluate the data of the grid-related network at the certificate level in a secure and efficient manner. This study provides a certificate-based enterprise privacy analysis and anomaly detection scheme. Using SSL/TLS and X.509 as standards, the scheme extracts valid certificate information by collecting certificate data traffic between enterprise networks and analyzing the certificate data. The scheme monitors and analyzes the flow of certificate data for the grid network, identifies suspicious anomalous behaviors and invalid certificates, and warns of risky behavior. By monitoring certificate data flow, it is feasible to improve the enterprise authentication framework and business communication method, prevent the leaking of enterprise privacy data."
8,blockchain-based collaborative certificate revocation systems using clustering,A. Didouh; H. Labiod; Y. E. Hillali; A. Rivenq,IEEE Access,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3160171,"Despite the decisive contribution of intelligent transport systems in road safety, they also open new vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, particularly vehicle position-linked attacks. For that reason, centralized systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the growth of the connected-vehicle fleets as it becomes more challenging to revoke certificates in real-time. We have proposed a new method that integrates a decentralized, collaborative system to meet these challenges. This method efficiently allows Blockchain integration for vehicular network’s cyber security by dynamically creating communities to revoke malicious vehicles in real-time. This article presents analytical models of the system of real-time revoking certificates and examines our solution’s impact on two important types of attacks in V2X communications, Sybil and the faking position attacks. Our experiments using real V2X hardware demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of real-time revocation via vehicle communities. The results were obtained from consensus implementation in a vehicular network comprising three communicating vehicles and a single roadside unit. In parallel, simulations showed feasibility in large-scale communications. As a result, the exposure and detection times of our solution meet real-time requirements."
9,certificate-aware encrypted traffic classification using second-order markov chain,Meng Shen; Mingwei Wei; Liehuang Zhu; Mingzhong Wang; Fuliang Li,2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS),2016,10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590451,"With the prosperity of network applications, traffic classification serves as a crucial role in network management and malicious attack detection. The widely used encryption transmission protocols, such as the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols, leads to the failure of traditional payload-based classification methods. Existing methods for encrypted traffic classification suffer from low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a certificate-aware encrypted traffic classification method based on the Second-Order Markov Chain. We start by exploring reasons why existing methods not perform well, and make a novel observation that certificate packet length in SSL/TLS sessions contributes to application discrimination. To increase the diversity of application fingerprints, we develop a new model by incorporating the certificate packet length clustering into the Second-Order homogeneous Markov chains. Extensive evaluation results show that the proposed method lead to a 30% improvement on average compared with the state-of-the-art method, in terms of classification accuracy."

Clark,2022 IEEE 61st Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),2022,10.1109/CDC51059.2022.9992432,"Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) fuse proprioceptive sensors such as GPS and exteroceptive sensors including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and cameras for state estimation and environmental observation. It has been shown that both types of sensors can be compromised by malicious attacks, leading to unacceptable safety violations. We study the problem of safety-critical control of a LiDAR-based system under sensor faults and attacks. We propose a framework consisting of fault tolerant estimation and fault tolerant control. The former reconstructs a LiDAR scan with state estimations, and excludes the possible faulty estimations that are not aligned with LiDAR measurements. We also verify the correctness of LiDAR scans by comparing them with the reconstructed ones and removing the possibly compromised sector in the scan. Fault tolerant control computes a control signal with the remaining estimations at each time step. We prove that the synthesized control input guarantees system safety using control barrier certificates. We validate our proposed framework using a UAV delivery system in an urban environment. We show that our proposed approach guarantees safety for the UAV whereas a baseline fails."
11,certificateless linkable ring signature-based blockchains for securing cognitive radio networks,Duraisamy A.K.; Ramaraj R.G.; Manoharan M.; Alagarsamy M.,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2022,10.1002/cpe.7235,"Rapid advancement in industrial applications of Internet of Things (IoT) has dramatically increased the number of Internet connected devices resulting in big challenges of scalability, adaptability, connectivity, and accessibility. Cognitive radio is efficient in handling spectrum allocation problem by facilitating the allocation of unlicensed spectrum dynamically to the IoT applications. However, cognitive radio network (CRN) capability of spectrum sensing is highly vulnerable to diversified number of security attacks. Malicious user disturbs the spectrum sensing potential and minimizes its accuracy by launching attacks during the detection of primary signal. In this article, certificateless linkable ring signature-based blockchains (CLRSB) is proposed for securing CRNs by achieving reliable discrimination between trustworthy users through cryptographic keys. It initially transformed the complete set of users such as PUs and SUs into the structure of blocks representing the smart contracts-based traditional public ledger blockchain that gets integrated to form a decentralized network for attaining improvement in efficient spectrum sensing. It adopted a mayfly optimization algorithm (MFOA)-improved CNN (MFOA-ICNN)-based spectrum sensing method for preventing the interference between PUs and SUs during spectrum access. It also used MFOA for optimizing the features with balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation to identify the remarkable features that attributes toward efficient spectrum sensing. It specifically used CLRS for protecting information about the transaction initiator for the objective of protecting blockchain privacy. Simulation experiments of this CLRSB confirmed better response time and minimized frame loss on an average by 18.13% and 17.81%, better than the baseline schemes used for investigation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

13,sybil attack detection based on authentication process using digital security certificate procedure for data transmission in manet,Muthusamy P.; Sheela T.,International Journal of Engineering and Technology(UAE),2018,,"Mobile devices are becoming very popular due to the wide range of networking competence for the mobile device users. The security issues in MANET become the control towards the management of the multiple numbers of nodes in the MANET is distributed. To strategy for overcome the Sybil attack in MANET and improve the efficiency of the Sybil attack detection by enhancing the data confidentiality and reliability. The primary objective of this research work is to develop a scheme to detect and prevent the Sybil attack in the MANET and to provide a highly reliable data transmission approach. The proposed system ensures the availability, confidentiality, authenticity and reliability of the information using digital certificate chains and secret sharing schemes. To detect the sybil node during the route discovery process, the nodes authenticate each other by providing the digital security certificate (DSC). The digital security certificate proves the nodes and allows only authorized node to participate in the route to transmit the data packets from the source to destination. It will not ensure the confidential data transmission when the legitimate node exhibits the malicious behavior in certain circumstances. When any intermediate nodes learn about the data packet that is being transmitted, then the security in data transmission becomes a critical factor. The safety of the network can be enhanced by preventing the sybil attack in MANET by increasing the data confidentiality and reliability. Only certified and authenticated nodes can participate in the route to transfer the data packets between the nodes. To prevent the sybil attack, it is necessary to secure the data that is transmitted over the insecure communication routes. © 2018 Authors."

Most of the currently existing security algorithms designed for these MANETs are insecure, inefficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes misbehavior. A novel trust based Certificate Authority concept is introduced to transmit data packets only through trusted nodes and isolate malicious nodes in the MANET. The proposed trust management scheme incorporates battery power consumption and packet integrity aspect in addition to direct and indirect trust values.

15,malicious ssl certificate detection: a step towards advanced persistent threat defence,Ghafir I.; Prenosil V.; Hammoudeh M.; Han L.; Raza U.,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017,10.1145/3102304.3102331,"Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is one of the most serious types of cyber attacks, which is a new and more complex version of multistep attack. Within the APT life cycle, continuous communication between infected hosts and Command and Control (C&C) servers is maintained to instruct and guide the compromised machines. these communications are usually protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, making it difficult to identify if the traffic directed to sites is malicious. This paper presents a Malicious SSL certificate Detection (MSSLD) module, which aims at detecting the APT C&C communications based on a blacklist of malicious SSL certificates. This blacklist consists of two forms of SSL certificates, the SHA1 fingerprints and the serial & subject, that are associated with malware and malicious activities. In this detection module, the network traffic is processed and all secure connections are filtered. The SSL certificate of each secure connection is then matched with the SSL certificate blacklist. This module was experimentally evaluated and the results show successful detection of malicious SSL certificates. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery."
16,certrust: an sdn-based framework for the trust of certificates against crossfire attacks in iot scenarios,Yan L.; Ma M.; Li D.; Huang X.; Ma Y.; Xie K.,CMES - Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences,2023,10.32604/cmes.2022.022462,"The low-intensity attack flows used by Crossfire attacks are hard to distinguish from legitimate flows. Traditional methods to identify the malicious flows in Crossfire attacks are rerouting, which is based on statistics. In these existing mechanisms, the identification of malicious flows depends on the IP address. However, the IP address is easy to be changed by attacks. Compared with the IP address, the certificate is more challenging to be tampered with or forged. Moreover, the traffic trend in the network is towards encryption. The certificates are popularly utilized by IoT devices for authentication in encryption protocols. DTLShps proposed a new way to verify certificates for resource-constrained IoT devices by using the SDN controller. Based on DTLShps, the SDN controller can collect statistics on certificates. In this paper, we propose Certrust, a framework based on the trust of certificates, to mitigate the Crossfire attack by using SDN for IoT. Our goal is threefold. First, the trust model is built based on the Bayesian trust system with the statistics on the participation of certificates in each Crossfire attack. Moreover, the forgetting curve is utilized instead of the traditional decay method in the Bayesian trust system for achieving a moderate decay rate. Second, for detecting the Crossfire attack accurately, a method based on graph connectivity is proposed. Third, several trust-based routing principles are proposed to mitigate the Crossfire attack. These principles can also encourage users to use certificates in communication. The performance evaluation shows that Certrust is more effective in mitigating the Crossfire attack than the traditional rerouting schemes. Moreover, our trust model has a more appropriate decay rate than the traditional methods. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved."
17,machine learning-based malicious x.509 certificates’ detection,Li J.; Zhang Z.; Guo C.,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021,10.3390/app11052164,"X.509 certificates play an important role in encrypting the transmission of data on both sides under HTTPS. With the popularization of X.509 certificates, more and more criminals leverage certificates to prevent their communications from being exposed by malicious traffic analysis tools. Phishing sites and malware are good examples. Those X.509 certificates found in phishing sites or malware are called malicious X.509 certificates. This paper applies different machine learning models, including classical machine learning models, ensemble learning models, and deep learning models, to distinguish between malicious certificates and benign certificates with Verification for Extraction (VFE). The VFE is a system we design and implement for obtaining plentiful characteristics of certificates. The result shows that ensemble learning models are the most stable and efficient models with an average accuracy of 95.9%, which outperforms many previous works. In addition, we obtain an SVM-based detection model with an accuracy of 98.2%, which is the highest accuracy. The outcome indicates the VFE is capable of capturing essential and crucial characteristics of malicious X.509 certificates. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
18,certificate revocation schemes for providing secure qos in manets,Sahana D.S.; Gopala krishnan C.,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2023,10.1002/cpe.7524,"Due to crucial exchange issues, security in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is more complicated. It is vital to secure MANET exchanges to ensure the network's services development. In this research, the proposed model focuses on providing trust and certificate-based Malicious Node detection for mobile adhoc networks and improving certificate revocation based on cluster head. The cluster head is crucial in eliminating falsely accused nodes. The malicious node may be easily discovered and isolated from the network using the trusted value. If the trust value falls below the trust threshold value in a trust management, the node is identified as malicious, the certificate is canceled, and the node is isolated from the network. The TSQRS protocol's integration with the CRS scheme was the main emphasis of the suggested model. The proposed model also creates more stable clusters with the help of Trust manager. When compared to other current protocols and methodologies, the findings produced by the suggested approach for the TSQRS-CRS scheme improve performance and stability in the QoS of MANETs.

19,phish-hook: detecting phishing certificates using certificate transparency logs,Fasllija E.; Enişer H.F.; Prünster B.,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",2019,10.1007/978-3-030-37231-6_18,"Certificate misissuance is a growing issue in the context of phishing attacks, as it leads inexperienced users to further trust fraudulent websites, if they are equipped with a technically valid certificate. Certificate Transparency (CT) aims at increasing the visibility of such malicious actions by requiring certificate authorities (CAs) to log every certificate they issue in public, tamper-proof, append-only logs. This work introduces Phish-Hook, a novel approach towards detecting phishing websites based on machine learning. Phish-Hook analyses certificates submitted to the CT system based on a conceptually simple, well-understood classification mechanism to effectively attest the phishing likelihood of newly issued certificates. Phish-Hook relies solely on CT log data and foregoes intricate analyses of websites’ source code and traffic. As a consequence, we are able to provide classification results in near real-time and in a resource-efficient way. Our approach advances the state of the art by classifying websites according to five different incremental certificate risk labels, instead of assigning a binary label. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a success rate of over 90%, while requiring fewer, less complex input data, and delivering results in near real-time. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019."

For improving the security, the most important thing is to examine the trustworthiness of nodes or mobile devices by identifying selfish and malicious nodes in the network. We are using the concept of trust and applying it on popular routing protocols of MANETs like DSR and AODV for providing secure routing. And also we are using the following algorithms, calculation of trust value (level) algorithm, identification of node misbehavior and modification of trust value algorithm, certificate distribution algorithm, and route innovation and maintenance algorithm for all the nodes in the network.

21,hunting malicious tls certificates with deep neural networks,Torroledo I.; Camacho L.D.; Bahnsen A.C.,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2018,10.1145/3270101.3270105,"Encryption is widely used across the internet to secure communications and ensure that information cannot be intercepted and read by a third party. However, encryption also allows cybercriminals to hide their messages and carry out successful malware attacks while avoiding detection. Further aiding criminals is the fact that web browsers display a green lock symbol in the URL bar when a connection to a website is encrypted. This symbol gives a false sense of security to users, who are in turn more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. The risk of encrypted traffic means that information security researchers must explore new techniques to detect, classify, and take countermeasures against malicious traffic. So far there exists no approach for TLS detection in the wild. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying malicious use of web certificates using deep neural networks. Our system uses the content of TLS certificates to successfully identify legitimate certificates as well as malicious patterns used by attackers. The results show that our system is capable of identifying malware certificates with an accuracy of 94.87% and phishing certificates with an accuracy of 88.64%.

This i motivated by phishing domains that have started to abuse the (erroneous) trust of the public in browser padloc symbols, and by the large-scale adoption of the Certificate Transparency (CT) framework. This publicl accessible evidence trail of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates has made the TLS landscape mor transparent than ever. By comparing samples of phishing, popular benign, and non-popular benign domains we provide insight into the TLS certificates issuance behavior for phishing domains, focusing on the selectio of the certificate authority, the validation level of the certificates, and the phenomenon of certificate sharin among phishing domains. Our results show that phishing domains gravitate to a relatively small selection o certificate authorities, and disproportionally to cPanel, and tend to rely on certificates with a low, and cheap validation level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the vast majority of certificates issued for phishing domain cover more than only phishing domains. These results suggest that a more pro-active role of CAs and puttin more emphasis on certificate revocation can have a crucial impact in the defense against phishing attacks.

Among the most interesting wireless networks, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks are remarkable because road safety and traffic efficiency are two advances that any developed society should undertake. Therefore, research on such networks should evolve to take the final step and move from theory to reality. However, first, it is necessary to improve many aspects related to security. In particular, identification and management of malicious users within the network are major research issues. The traditional method using revocation lists to manage these users becomes very inefficient when the network grows. This paper proposes an alternative method to efficiently manage malicious users, which uses hash trees and query frequencies in order to fit better with the needs of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

As of now, majority of individuals and communities are using X.509 certificates to demonstrate their ID during on-line exchanges, so the unwavering quality and risk level of these certificates come into a question. Hence, we have proposed a framework which assesses risk associated with X.509 Certificates with the help of certain trust criteria and characteristics. For evaluating risk related with certificate we use classification Technique with machine learning algorithm, which categorizes risk of certificate in three levels-High Risk, Medium Risk and Low risk. Our system is useful to find out risk associated with certificate while user carries out important transactions. User needs to input the certificate and system will provide risk associated with that certificate and if it is a high risk or medium risk certificate it will mention due to which parameter it bears risk. Our framework has application in browser-server communication and detecting phishing websites which have Https URLs. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

25,an enhanced secure identity-based certificateless public key authentication scheme for vehicular sensor networks,Li C.; Zhang X.; Wang H.; Li D.,Sensors (Switzerland),2018,10.3390/s18010194,"Vehicular sensor networks have been widely applied in intelligent traffic systems in recent years. Because of the specificity of vehicular sensor networks, they require an enhanced, secure and efficient authentication scheme. Existing authentication protocols are vulnerable to some problems, such as a high computational overhead with certificate distribution and revocation, strong reliance on tamper-proof devices, limited scalability when building many secure channels, and an inability to detect hardware tampering attacks. In this paper, an improved authentication scheme using certificateless public key cryptography is proposed to address these problems. A security analysis of our scheme shows that our protocol provides an enhanced secure anonymous authentication, which is resilient against major security threats. Furthermore, the proposed scheme reduces the incidence of node compromise and replication attacks. The scheme also provides a malicious-node detection and warning mechanism, which can quickly identify compromised static nodes and immediately alert the administrative department. With performance evaluations, the scheme can obtain better trade-offs between security and efficiency than the well-known available schemes. © 2018 by the authors."

Right now, during online exchanges, many people and groups are using X.509 certificates to represent their identity, so the level of excellence and reliability of these certificates become dubious. Hence, we introduced a framework which computes risk associated with X.509 certificates with the assistance of certain trust criteria and attributes. For assessing risk related with certificate, we utilized Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm, which categorizes risk in three levels- High, Medium and Low. User needs to input the certificate and the system will predict the risk associated with that certificate. If predicted risk is high or medium, system will specify the parameter due to which it triggers risk.

It takes a vital role in safety fields such as defense system, traffic system, etc. Even though, some advanced Public Key Infrastructure and digital signature method was used for security, intrusion detection is an inevitable challenge in networks. Prevention and detection of malicious vehicle from jeopardizing the safety of the other vehicle is focused in this paper by using region-based FBB (Flooding-Bilinear-Bloom Filter) authentication protocol. Authentication is performed in any PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) system by checking if the certificate of the sender is included in the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) and verifying the authenticity and checking the sign of the sender. Bilinear pairing method is used to create an anonymous Id for each vehicle. The CRL checking process has been done using Bloom Filter method which avoids false negative. CRL can be passed between vehicles by bidirectional flooding method which avoids network congestion. This paper focuses mainly the CRL dissemination using the bi-directional flooding method. It replaces the time-consuming CRL Checking process. It reduces message loss ratio by using fast revocation checking and CRL updating method as well as it needs very less memory space compared to other methods. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved."

We observe through our deep dive analysis that artifacts of phishing are manifested in various sources of intelligence related to a domain even before its contents are online. In particular, we study various novel patterns and characteristics computed from viable sources of data including Certificate Transparency Logs, and passive DNS records. To compare benign and phishing domains, we construct thoroughly-verified realistic benign and phishing datasets. Our analysis shows clear differences between benign and phishing domains that can pave the way for content-agnostic approaches to predict phishing domains even before the contents of these webpages are up and running. To demonstrate the usefulness of our analysis, we train a classifier with distinctive features, and we show that we can (1) perform content-agnostic predictions with a very low FPR of 0.3%, and high precision (98%) and recall (90%), and (2) predict phishing domains days before they are discovered by state-of-the-art content-based tools such as VirusTotal.  © 2022 ACM."
29,malicious node detection on routing via certificate authority and optimal fuzzy for wireless ad-hoc network,Rajkumar K.; Jeyakumar M.K.,International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering,2019,10.35940/ijrte.C4601.098319,"Wireless Ad-Hoc network has a set of nodes which designed with wireless transceivers. These nodes communicate with each other by accessing the common channel. In the ad-hoc network, security is one of the main challenges. Due to the behavior of malicious nodes, the security of the network is compromised. So, the major objective of this paper is to improve the security of the network by combining both malicious node detection and cryptography techniques. In this paper, an optimized fuzzy system is presented for the detection of malicious nodes which are malfunctioning in the routing path between source and destination. To optimize the performance of the fuzzy system, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented. After the detection of malicious nodes, each normal behavior node in the network is authenticated by the Certificate Authority (CA). Then the authenticated nodes transmit the data packets to the destination with the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of the optimized fuzzy system is improved than that of the conventional fuzzy system for malicious node detection in terms of delivery ratio, detection time and energy efficiency. © BEIESP."
30,a strongly unforgeable certiﬁcateless signature scheme and its application in iot environments,Yang X.; Pei X.; Chen G.; Li T.; Wang M.; Wang C.,Sensors (Switzerland),2019,10.3390/s19122692,"With the widespread application of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring communication security for IoT devices is of considerable importance. Since IoT data are vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, forgery, and other attacks during an open network transmission, the integrity and authenticity of data are fundamental security requirements in the IoT. A certificateless signature (CLS) is a viable solution for providing data integrity, data authenticity, and identity identification in resource-constrained IoT devices. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient CLS scheme for IoT environments has become one of the main objectives of IoT security research. However, the existing CLS schemes rarely focus on strong unforgeability and replay attacks. Herein, we design a novel CLS scheme to protect the integrity and authenticity of IoT data. In addition to satisfying the strong unforgeability requirement, the proposed scheme also resists public key replacement attacks, malicious-but-passive key-generation-centre attacks, and replay attacks. Compared with other related CLS schemes without random oracles, our CLS scheme has a shorter private key, stronger security, and lower communication and computational costs. © 2019 by the authors.

In this work, we design and implement a tool called DCDroid to detect these vulnerabilities with the combination of static and dynamic analysis. In static analysis, we focus on four types of vulnerable schema and locate the potential vulnerable code snippets in apps. In dynamic analysis, we prioritize the triggering of User Interface (UI) components based on the results obtained with static analysis to confirm the misuse of SSL/TLS. With DCDroid we analyze 2213 apps from Google Play and 360app. The experimental results show that 457 (20.65%) apps contain potential vulnerable code. We run apps with DCDroid on two Android smart phones and confirm that 245 (11.07%) of 2213 apps are truly vulnerable to MITM and phishing attacks. We propose several strategies to reduce the number of crashes and shorten the execution time in dynamic analysis. Comparing with our previous work, DCDroid decreases 57.18% of the number of apps’ crash and 32.47% of the execution time on average. It also outperforms other three tools, namely, AndroBugs, kingkong and appscan, in terms of detection accuracy. © 2020"

Because people trust in encryption technology, a series of attack methods based on certificates have been de-rived. Malicious certificates protect many malicious behaviors and threaten data security. To counter this threat, machine learning algorithms are widely used in malicious certificate detection. However, the detection efficiency of such algorithms largely depends on whether the extracted features can effectively represent the data. In contrast, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can automatically extract useful features. GCNs are powerful at fitting graph data, which can improve the effectiveness of learning systems by efficiently embedding prior knowledge in an end-to-end manner. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for detecting malicious digital certificates with GCNs. Firstly, we transform the digital certificate dataset with pem document structure into a corpus of graph structure based on attribute co-occurrence and document attribute relations. Then, we put the graph structure certificate dataset into a GCN for training. The results of the experiment show that GCN is very effective in certificate classification and outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and extant neural network algorithms. The accuracy of our algorithm to detect malicious certificates is 97.41%. This shows that our algorithm is very effective. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

CT assumes that any individual can undertake the role of a CT monitor which fetches all the certificates in the logs and discovers suspicious ones from them. However, studies in recent years shows that ordinary individuals have to pay an unbearable price to operate a monitor by themselves, which makes the originally distributed trust be concentrated on several third-party monitors. Unfortunately, some researches indicate that problems of timeliness, security, and reliability exist in third-party monitors. In this paper, we propose the PoliCT, a flexible and customizable certificate transparency management solution where domain owners can designate how their certificates should be submitted and validated. It enables domain owners (a) to release their CT policies to monitor a few logs purposefully, thereby greatly reducing monitoring costs; (b) to demand more SCTs to increase the transparency of their certificates. After that, we discuss the design of a reliable lightweight self-monitor in detail. Expectably, the actual data collection and the theoretical analysis of the prototype system show that PoliCT enables a common individual to maintain its CT policies with negligible overhead, and significantly improves the performance of monitoring service."

36,a provably secure certificate-based encryption scheme against malicious ca attacks in the standard model,"Lu Y,Li J",,2016,10.1016/j.ins.2016.08.082,"Certificate-based encryption (CBE) is a new public-key cryptographic paradigm that represents an interesting balance between conventional public-key encryption and identity-based encryption. It not only simplifies the certificate revocation problem in conventional public-key encryption, but also solves the key escrow problem inherent in identity-based encryption. In CBE, a certificate authority (CA) is employed to initialize the system and issue certificates for users. Each user needs both a private key and an up-to-date certificate to decrypt ciphertexts. In the previous concrete constructions of CBE, the CA is assumed to be honest-but-curious, that is, the CA always starts launching attacks only after it has initialized the system honestly. However, it seems that such an assumption does not necessarily reflect reality when we consider a malicious CA that is trying every effort to break the system. To show that the malicious CA attack exists in CBE, we present two concrete attacks against a previous CBE scheme. In both attacks, a malicious CA can easily break any user's confidentiality by implanting a trapdoor in the public system parameters. To fight against malicious CA attacks, we propose a new CBE scheme. The proposed CBE scheme is proven to be chosen-ciphertext secure against malicious CA attacks in the standard model. Performance comparison shows that it is efficient and practical."

One possible approach to shorten this window aims to detect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Previous attempts to work with CT log data for phishing classification exist, however they lack evaluations on actual CT log data. In this paper, we present a pipeline that facilitates such evaluations by addressing a number of problems when working with CT log data. The pipeline includes dataset creation, training, and past or live classification of CT logs. Its modular structure makes it possible to easily exchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling efforts and classifier comparisons. We test the pipeline on a number of new and existing classifiers, and find a general potential to improve classifiers for this scenario in the future. We publish the source code of the pipeline and the used datasets along with this paper [12], thus making future research in this direction more accessible."

However, we find that the scheme cannot reach the claimed security feature. Specifically, in this paper, we will demonstrate that in Luo and Wan’s CLSC scheme, the plaintext can be easily recovered from the ciphertext by ordinary attacker and malicious-but-passive KGC. In addition, we identify that this scheme even cannot resist forgery attack of a malicious KGC."

Therefore, they should be accompanied by an efficient mechanism for certificate revocation and validation. Ad hoc distributed OCSP for trust (ADOPT) is a lightweight, distributed, on-demand scheme based on cached OCSP responses, which provides certificate status information to the nodes of a MANET. In this paper we discuss the ADOPT scheme and issues on its deployment over MANETs. We present some possible threats to ADOPT and suggest the use of a trust assessment and establishment framework, named ad hoc trust framework (ATF), to support ADOPT's robustness and efficiency. ADOPT is deployed as a trust-aware application that provides feedback to ATF, which calculates the trustworthiness of the peer nodes' functions and helps ADOPT to improve its performance by rapidly locating valid certificate status information. Moreover, we introduce the TrustSpan algorithm to reduce the overhead that ATF produces, and the TrustPath algorithm to identify and use trusted routes for propagating sensitive information, such as third parties' accusations. Simulation results show that ATF adds limited overhead compared to its efficiency in detecting and isolating malicious and selfish nodes. ADOPT's reliability is increased, since it can rapidly locate a legitimate response by using information provided by ATF."
41,patchcensor: patch robustness certification for transformers via exhaustive testing,"Huang Y,Ma L,Li Y",,2023,10.1145/3591870,"In the past few years, Transformer has been widely adopted in many domains and applications because of its impressive performance. Vision Transformer (ViT), a successful and well-known variant, attracts considerable attention from both industry and academia thanks to its record-breaking performance in various vision tasks. However, ViT is also highly nonlinear like other classical neural networks and could be easily fooled by both natural and adversarial perturbations. This limitation could pose a threat to the deployment of ViT in the real industrial environment, especially in safety-critical scenarios. How to improve the robustness of ViT is thus an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. Among all kinds of robustness, patch robustness is defined as giving a reliable output when a random patch in the input domain is perturbed. The perturbation could be natural corruption, such as part of the camera lens being blurred. It could also be a distribution shift, such as an object that does not exist in the training data suddenly appearing in the camera. And in the worst case, there could be a malicious adversarial patch attack that aims to fool the prediction of a machine learning model by arbitrarily modifying pixels within a restricted region of an input image. This kind of attack is also called physical attack as it is believed to be more real than digital attack. Although there has been some work on patch robustness improvement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), related studies on its counterpart ViT are still at an early stage as ViT is usually much more complex with far more parameters. It is harder to assess and improve its robustness, not to mention to provide a provable guarantee. In this work, we propose PatchCensor, aiming to certify the patch robustness of ViT by applying exhaustive testing. We try to provide a provable guarantee by considering the worst patch attack scenarios. Unlike empirical defenses against adversarial patches that may be adaptively breached, certified robust approaches can provide a certified accuracy against arbitrary attacks under certain conditions. However, existing robustness certifications are mostly based on robust training, which often requires substantial training efforts and the sacrifice of model performance on normal samples. To bridge the gap, PatchCensor seeks to improve the robustness of the whole system by detecting abnormal inputs instead of training a robust model and asking it to give reliable results for every input, which may inevitably compromise accuracy. Specifically, each input is tested by voting over multiple inferences with different mutated attention masks, where at least one inference is guaranteed to exclude the abnormal patch. This can be seen as complete-coverage testing, which could provide a statistical guarantee on inference at the test time. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PatchCensor is able to achieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel adversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques while achieving similar clean accuracy (81.8% on ImageNet). The clean accuracy is the same as vanilla ViT models. Meanwhile, our technique also supports flexible configurations to handle different adversarial patch sizes by simply changing the masking strategy."

In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collaborative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in online tests. The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating."

However, the lack of a unified set of definitions and security models currently hinders its progression as much effort has been put on refining the definitions and looking for an appropriate and practical security models. In this article, we aim to contribute on unifying the definitions and security models for Certificateless Encryption (CLE) schemes. First, we show that the original seven-algorithm definition is equivalent to a simplified five-algorithm definition. We believe that this simplified definition may lead to more compact and efficient implementations in practice and also help in the effort of standardisation of CLE. Secondly, we show that a CLE scheme cannot be both malicious Key Generation Center (KGC) secure and strongly secure in the standard model. Due to the practicality and attacking significance of malicious KGC security; and the uncertainty of how practical the strong security is, we, therefore, suggest constructing practical CLE schemes to be malicious KGC secure. Finally, we propose to formalise a new adversarial capability called partial key replacement attack into the security models and show that our generic scheme proposed recently is secure against this new type of attacks."

The first concrete certificateless partially blind signature (CLPBS) scheme for e‐cash was constructed in 2011. Recently it was found that this construction had a security weakness and a rescued scheme was given. Unfortunately, the formal security proof was not given. In this study, the authors first give cryptanalysis of their rescued scheme. They demonstrate that a malicious user in their rescued scheme can forge a signature on any message by replacing the signer's public key. In an e‐cash system, blind signatures issued by the bank are viewed as e‐cash. Once they apply their scheme to an untraceable e‐cash system, a malicious user can forge valid electronic coins (i.e. valid signatures) without being detected by the bank. It will result in loss of the bank. Then, they propose a newly improved CLPBS scheme which achieves the strongest security level and has higher computational efficiency than the rescued scheme published earlier. Finally, they give an example of potential application to e‐cash systems using their scheme."

Pinning can provide enhanced security to defend against malicious third-party access to sensitive data in transit (e.g., to protect sensitive banking and health care information), but can also hide an app's personal data collection from users and auditors. Prior studies found pinning was rarely used in the Android ecosystem, except in high-profile, security-sensitive apps; and, little is known about its usage on iOS and across mobile platforms.In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the use of certificate pinning on Android and iOS. We collect 5,079 unique apps from the two official app stores: 575 common apps, 1,000 popular apps each, and 1,000 randomly selected apps each. We develop novel, cross-platform, static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect the usage of certificate pinning. Thus, our study offers a more comprehensive understanding of certificate pinning than previous studies.We find certificate pinning as much as 4 times more widely adopted than reported in recent studies. More specifically, we find that 0.9% to 8% of Android apps and 2.5% to 11% of iOS apps use certificate pinning at run time (depending on the aforementioned sets of apps). We then investigate which categories of apps most frequently use pinning (e.g., apps in the ""finance"" category), which destinations are typically pinned (e.g., first-party destinations vs those used by third-party libraries), which certificates are pinned and how these are pinned (e.g., CA vs leaf certificates), and the connection security for pinned connections vs unpinned ones (e.g., the use of weak ciphers or improper certificate validation). Lastly, we investigate how many pinned connections are amenable to binary instrumentation to reveal the contents of their connections; for those that are, we analyze the data sent over pinned connections to understand what is protected by pinning."

It not only solves the key escrow problem inherent in IBC, but also simplifies the certificate problem in traditional PKC. So far, several certificate‐based signature (CBS) schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, none of them consider the malicious certificate authority (CA) attack. Cryptanalysis shows that two previous CBS schemes without random oracles fail in achieving unforgeability under such attack. To overcome the security weakness in these schemes, the authors propose an improved CBS scheme that can withstand malicious CA attacks. They prove it to be existentially unforgeable against chosen message attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption in the standard model. Compared with the previous standard‐model CBS schemes, the proposed scheme has obvious advantages in both the computation and communication efficiency."

If the KGC is malicious, it can always impersonate the user. Certificateless cryptography, introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson in 2003, is intended to solve this problem. However, in all the previously proposed certificateless schemes, it is always assumed that the malicious KGC starts launching attacks (so-called Type II attacks) only after it has generated a master public/secret key pair honestly. In this paper, we propose new security models that remove this assumption for both certificateless signature and encryption schemes. Under the new models, we show that a class of certificateless encryption and signature schemes proposed previously are insecure. These schemes still suffer from the key escrow problem. On the other side, we also give new proofs to show that there are two generic constructions, one for certificateless signature and the other for certificateless encryption, proposed recently that are secure under our new models."

We assume that one of the devices of the network has been cloned. Everything, including saved passwords, certificates and secret keys. We propose a solution in networks of mobile devices carried by individuals -- composedby nodes that can communicate by short-range technology like bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and links appear and disappear according to social relationships between users. Our idea is to use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal smart phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the owner of the device and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks and Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol that works well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the network that tries to use the stolen credentials in the social community of the original device that has been cloned. Community Certificates works well when the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen credentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social network from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an excellent protection against this very strong attack. We prove our ideas and solutions with extensive simulations in both simulated and real world scenarios -- with mobility traces collected in a real life experiment."

For example, malicious domains' certificates issued by compromised CAs are widespread, and revoked certificates are still trusted by clients. In spite of a lot of research to improve the security of SSL/TLS connections, there are still some problems unsolved. On one hand, although log-based schemes provided certificate audit service to quickly detect CAs' misbehavior, the security and data consistency of log servers are ignored. On the other hand, revoked certificates checking is neglected due to the incomplete, insecure and inefficient certificate revocation mechanisms. Further, existing revoked certificates checking schemes are centralized which would bring safety bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based public and efficient audit scheme for TLS connections, which is called Certchain. Specially, we propose a dependability-rank based consensus protocol in our blockchain system and a new data structure to support certificate forward traceability. Furthermore, we present a method that utilizes dual counting bloom filter (DCBF) with eliminating false positives to achieve economic space and efficient query for certificate revocation checking. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that CertChain is suitable in practice with moderate overhead."
55,on the security of a provably secure certificateless strong designated verifier signature scheme based on bilinear pairings,"Lin HY,Ting PY,Yang LF",Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Telecommunications and Communication Engineering,2017,10.1145/3145777.3145784,"A strong designated verifier signature (SDVS) is a variation of traditional digital signatures, since it allows a signer to designate an intended receiver as the verifier rather than anyone. To do this, a signer must incorporate the verifier's public key with the signing procedure such that only the intended receiver could verify this signature with his/her private key. Such a signature further enables a designated verifier to simulate a computationally indistinguishable transcript intended for himself. Consequently, no one can identify the real signer's identity from a candidate signer and a designated verifier, which is referred to as the property of signer ambiguity. A strong notion of signer ambiguity states that no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish the real signer of a given SDVS that is not received by the designated verifier, even if the adversary has obtained the signer's private key. In 2013, Islam and Biswas proposed a provably secure certificateless strong designated verifier signature (CL-SDVS) scheme based on bilinear pairings. In this paper, we will demonstrate that their scheme fails to satisfy strong signer ambiguity and must assume a trusted private key generator (PKG). In other words, their CL-SDVS scheme is vulnerable to both key-compromise and malicious PKG attacks. Additionally, we present an improved variant to eliminate these weaknesses."

Ad hoc networks have emerged from this technology to provide new services to mobile users. In contrast with conventional wireless networks, ad hoc networks are not connected to any stationary infrastructure. Furthermore, the mobility functions, such as routing, connection's decisions and security managements, are performed by the nodes themselves independently. Therefore, the security problem for mobile ad hoc networks is becoming one of the major issues that need to be solved. The security of ad hoc networks is based on certification authority (CA) which issues and manages security certificates and public keys for message encryption. This paper introduces a new method of detecting unauthorized intrusion that is used by malicious user who issues a forged certificate to join a group of ad hoc network. This method also eliminates unnecessary certificates exchange among users' nodes to reduce traffic flow inside the network."

However, certification validation incurs non-trivial overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, because it either requires long latency or large cache space. This work proposes to utilize the power of distributed caching and explores the feasibility of using the cache spaces on all IoT devices as a large pool to store validated certificates. We design a Collaborative Certificate Validation (CCV) protocol including a memory-efficient and fast locator for certificate holders, a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of devices, and a protocol suite for dynamic update and certificate revocation. Evaluation results show that CCV only uses less than 25% validation time and reduces >90% decryption operations on each device, compared to a recent method. Malicious devices that conduct dishonest validations can be detected by the network using the proposed trust model."

However, the private key escrow problem of these schemes makes them unsuitable in practical environments because the private key generator computes signer private key using signer public identity. Therefore, an untrusted/semitrusted private key generator may perform malicious activity on behalf of the signer. We took the advantage of certificateless public key cryptography and constructed a robust and efficient certificateless blind signature CL-BS scheme using bilinear pairing. Furthermore, the probabilistic map-to-point hash function, which requires more computation time than the execution time of an elliptic curve scalar point multiplication, is circumvented in our scheme. We found that our scheme is unlinkable and provably secure against the adaptive chosen message and identity adversaries. From the perspective of computational costs, our scheme is more efficient and secure than other related schemes. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

In this paper, we study forged certificates in the wild based on a long term large scale passive measurement. With the combination of certificate transparency (CT) logs and our measurement results, nearly 3 million forged certificates against the Alexa Top 10K sites are identified and studied. Our analysis reveals the causes and preference of forged certificates, as well as several significant differences from the benign ones.

In this model, the system remains secure even in the presence of a certain threshold t of corrupted/malicious nodes.In this paper, we show how to perform necessary public key operations without node-specific certificates in ad hoc networks. These operations include pair-wise key establishment, signing, and encryption. We achieve this by using Feldman's verifiable polynomial secret sharing (VSS) as a key distribution scheme and treating the secret shares as the private keys. Unlike in the standard public key cryptography, where entities have independent private/public key pairs, in the proposed scheme the private keys are related (they are points on a polynomial of degree t) and each public key can be computed from the public VSS information and node identifier. We show that such related keys can still be securely used for standard signature and encryption operations (using resp. Schnorr signatures and ElGamal encryption) and for pairwise key establishment, as long as there are no more that t collusions/corruptions in the system.The proposed usage of shares as private keys can also be viewed as a threshold-tolerant identity-based cryptosystem under standard (discrete logarithm based) assumptions."

However, the lack of a clear in-depth defense line in such a new networking paradigm would make its potential users worry about the leakage of their private information, especially to those unauthenticated or even malicious adversaries. In this paper, we present a pair of efficient and light-weight authentication protocols to enable remote WBAN users to anonymously enjoy healthcare service. In particular, our authentication protocols are rooted with a novel certificateless signature (CLS) scheme, which is computational, efficient, and provably secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message attack in the random oracle model. Also, our designs ensure that application or service providers have no privilege to disclose the real identities of users. Even the network manager, which serves as private key generator in the authentication protocols, is prevented from impersonating legitimate users. The performance of our designs is evaluated through both theoretic analysis and experimental simulations, and the comparative studies demonstrate that they outperform the existing schemes in terms of better trade-off between desirable security properties and computational overhead, nicely meeting the needs of WBANs."

The IoV requires an efficient communication mode when the application scenarios are complicated. To reduce the verifying time and cut the length of signature, certificateless aggregate signature (CL-AS) is used to achieve improved performance in resource-constrained environments like vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which is able to make it effective in environments constrained by bandwidth and storage. However, in the real application scenarios, messages should be kept untamed, unleashed, and authentic. In addition, most of the proposed schemes tend to be easy to attack by signers or malicious entities which can be called coalition attack. In this paper, we present an improved certificateless-based authentication and aggregate signature scheme, which can properly solve the coalition attack. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only uses pseudonyms in communications to prevent vehicles from revealing their identity but also achieves considerable efficiency compared with state-of-the-art work, certificateless signature (CLS), and CL-AS schemes.

Besides, 5G-enabled vehicular networks also provide infotainment services and industry application services. High-strength data transmission, however, will bring a serious burden of resource overhead, and there are hidden dangers of security and privacy in the communication process of vehicular networks. Some current vehicular network authentication schemes adopt public key infrastructure-based (PKI-based) and identity-based authentication methods to achieve conditional privacy preservation. Still, these schemes are too expensive and cannot address the problems of costly certificate management or risky key escrow. Some schemes use computationally complex bilinear pairing operations that result in low efficiency and do not consider the revocation of malicious nodes so that they cannot effectively prevent further malicious attacks. This paper proposes a lightweight certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme with a revocation mechanism suitable for 5G-enabled vehicular networks in response to the above problems. Our proposed scheme uses aggregation signature technology to aggregate multiple signatures into a single short signature, thus reducing communication overhead and storage overhead of road side units (RSUs). Furthermore, our proposed scheme utilizes the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to reduce verification time and computational overhead. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious users from sending invalid signatures to attack, our proposed scheme uses binary search to identify invalid signatures and introduces a cuckoo filter to revoke malicious users to prevent reattack. Finally, formal proof and experimental analysis show that our proposed scheme has greater advantages with respect to security and efficiency compared with the previous schemes."

However, for various reasons, Android developers fail to properly implement SSL/TLS during the development of an app, resulting in security risks. The improper implementations include trusting all certificates, trusting all domain names, or ignoring certificate verification errors. These improper implementations may result in Man-In-The-Middle(MITM) attacks or phishing attacks. In this work, we are motivated to detect vulnerabilities in implementation of SSL/TLS in Android apps by designing and implementing a tool called DCDroid (Detecting SSL/TLS Certificate verification vulnerabilities in Android apps) with the combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis. We focus on four types of vulnerable schema and locate the potential vulnerable code snippets in apps with static analysis. In dynamic analysis, we prioritize the triggering of User Interface(UI) components based on the results with static analysis to confirm the misuse of SSL/TLS. The dynamic analysis benefits from the static analysis and removes false positives. With DCDroid we analyze 960 apps from Google Play and 1253 apps from 360app. The experimental results show that 457 (20.65%) apps contain potential security risks in the implementation of SSL/TLS. Guided by the static analysis, we further confirm that 248 (11.21%) out of 2213 apps are truly vulnerable to MITM and phishing attacks. By analyzing the categories, ranks and version evolution of these detected vulnerable apps, we find that apps of News&Books are more likely to introduce SSL/TLS risks. We also find that the fix cycle of the risk is very long. We provide suggestions on SSL/TLS certificate verification to Android developers in order to deal with the SSL/TLS certificate verification vulnerabilities."

However, at present, the speed of vehicle certification in IoV is slow, and the use of idle resources is not considered. To address this problem, this paper provides a blockchain-based vehicle identity verification scheme by using a hybrid identity code verification method to ensure the nodes in the network securely share information. Meanwhile, a task processing algorithm based on time window is proposed to optimize the utilization of idle resources. In addition, the method is evaluated by simulation experiment, and the designed scheme can reduce malicious behavior of a registered vehicle in the network, and can shorten the processing task delay."

Several methods and hazard analysis, and standards in different disciplines, have been defined in order to assure the systems have been designed in compliance with safety requirements. The increasing presence of automatic controlling operation, the massive use of networks to transfer data and information, and the human operations introduce a new security concern in safety-critical systems. Security issues (threats) do not only have direct impact on systems availability, integrity and confidentiality, but they also can influence the safety aspects of the safety critical systems. Today taking into account malicious actions through intrusion into communications and computer control systems become a critical and not negligible step during the design and the assessment of safety-critical systems. The paper describes a general methodology to support the assessment of safety-critical system with respect to security aspects. The methodology is based on a library of security threats. Such threats, identified during the work, have been mapped to the NIST security controls. Then, a preliminary representation of the library in the aerospace domain is shown through some simple example, together with some considerations on the relation between security issues and safety impact as a valuable addition to the safety critical systems certification process."

GARCM applies different result certification and scheduling algorithms to volunteer groups that are constructed according to their properties such as volunteering service time, availability and credibility."
82,a collaborative reputation-based vetting model for online certification of businesses,"Al Flasi A,Serhani MA,Barka E",Proceedings of the Second Kuwait Conference on E-Services and e-Systems,2011,10.1145/2107556.2107567,"Many organizations have opted to provide their services on the web to remain competitive and to reach wider market space. The open nature of the Internet and lack of barriers open the door to masqueraders to spoof the identity of service provider, and deals maliciously on his behalf. Therefore, a trust mechanism has to be reliable and robust enough to protect the customer and gain his/her confidence in conducting business transactions on the web. The first step towards conducting business transaction is to acquire a certification from a third party authority. However, this certification can be subject of frauds and attacks. To enforce reliable business certification, we propose in this paper a new collaborative reputation based vetting model for digital certificate acquisition. Our model uses a collaborative reputation based on rating the subject business applying for a certification and the number of transactions conducted with the business as well as the reputation of the raters. In addition, it employs a clustering technique to determine the honesty of raters and to implement a reward-penalty approach. We have evaluated our model using a case study and the obtained results prove that our model is robust enough to ensure a reliable certification of businesses."
