However, encryption also allows cybercriminals to hide their messages and carry out successful malware attacks while avoiding detection. Further aiding criminals is the fact that web browsers display a green lock symbol in the URL bar when a connection to a website is encrypted. This symbol gives a false sense of security to users, who are in turn more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. The risk of encrypted traffic means that information security researchers must explore new techniques to detect, classify, and take countermeasures against malicious traffic. So far there exists no approach for TLS detection in the wild. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying malicious use of web certificates using deep neural networks. Our system uses the content of TLS certificates to successfully identify legitimate certificates as well as malicious patterns used by attackers. The results show that our system is capable of identifying malware certificates with an accuracy of 94.87% and phishing certificates with an accuracy of 88.64%.","machine learning, network monitoring, web certificates, phishing, malware, deep learning., tls, ssl","","AISec '18"

As a promising Android malware detection scheme, we focus on the scheme leveraging the differences of traffic patterns between benign apps and malware. Those differences can be captured even if the packet is encrypted. However, since such features are just statistic based ones, they cannot identify whether each traffic is malicious. Thus, it is necessary to design the scheme which is applicable to encrypted traffic data and supports identification of malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection scheme based on the level of SSL server certificate. Attackers tend to use an untrusted certificate to encrypt malicious payloads in many cases because passing rigorous examination is required to get a trusted certificate. Thus, we utilize SSL server certificate based features for detection since their certificates tend to be untrusted. Furthermore, in order to obtain the more exact features, we introduce required permission based weight values because malware inevitably require permissions regarding malicious actions. By computer simulation with real dataset, we show our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.7 %. True positive rate and false positive rate are 5.6% higher and 3.3% lower than the previous scheme, respectively. Our scheme can cope with encrypted malicious payloads and 89 malware which are not detected by the previous scheme.","","",""

But, their open and dynamic nature renders them more suspicious to differentkinds of security attacksthan the wired networks. To meet these challenges, certificate revocation is a mechanism to provide secure network communication services. Certificate revocation is used to segregate attackers from participating in network activities in future. A Cluster-based Certificate Revocation mechanism is the best scheme used to revoke the certificates of malicious node present in the network. It provides the capability of detecting the falsely accused node in the network and revokesthe certificate of that node to address the problem of false accusation. To improve the reliability of this mechanism, warned nodes are kept apart from certificate revocation mechanism.","","","ICGCIOT '15"

Ironically, the mechanism CAs use to issue certificates is itself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by network-level adversaries. Autonomous Systems (ASes) can exploit vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to hijack traffic destined to a victim's domain. In this paper, we rigorously analyze attacks that an adversary can use to obtain a bogus certificate. We perform the first real-world demonstration of BGP attacks to obtain bogus certificates from top CAs in an ethical manner. To assess the vulnerability of the PKI, we collect a dataset of 1.8 million certificates and find that an adversary would be capable of gaining a bogus certificate for the vast majority of domains. Finally, we propose and evaluate two countermeasures to secure the PKI: 1) CAs verifying domains from multiple vantage points to make it harder to launch a successful attack, and 2) a BGP monitoring system for CAs to detect suspicious BGP routes and delay certificate issuance to give network operators time to react to BGP attacks.","","","SEC'18"

These communications are usually protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, making it difficult to identify if the traffic directed to sites is malicious. This paper presents a Malicious SSL certificate Detection (MSSLD) module, which aims at detecting the APT C&C communications based on a blacklist of malicious SSL certificates. This blacklist consists of two forms of SSL certificates, the SHA1 fingerprints and the serial & subject, that are associated with malware and malicious activities. In this detection module, the network traffic is processed and all secure connections are filtered. The SSL certificate of each secure connection is then matched with the SSL certificate blacklist.

CT assumes that any individual can undertake the role of a CT monitor which fetches all the certificates in the logs and discovers suspicious ones from them. However, studies in recent years shows that ordinary individuals have to pay an unbearable price to operate a monitor by themselves, which makes the originally distributed trust be concentrated on several third-party monitors. Unfortunately, some researches indicate that problems of timeliness, security, and reliability exist in third-party monitors. In this paper, we propose the PoliCT, a flexible and customizable certificate transparency management solution where domain owners can designate how their certificates should be submitted and validated. It enables domain owners (a) to release their CT policies to monitor a few logs purposefully, thereby greatly reducing monitoring costs; (b) to demand more SCTs to increase the transparency of their certificates. After that, we discuss the design of a reliable lightweight self-monitor in detail. Expectably, the actual data collection and the theoretical analysis of the prototype system show that PoliCT enables a common individual to maintain its CT policies with negligible overhead, and significantly improves the performance of monitoring service.","Monitor, Fraudulent certificate, PKI, Certificate transparency","",""

In particular, we study various novel patterns and characteristics computed from viable sources of data including Certificate Transparency Logs, and passive DNS records.

It not only simplifies the certificate revocation problem in conventional public-key encryption, but also solves the key escrow problem inherent in identity-based encryption. In CBE, a certificate authority (CA) is employed to initialize the system and issue certificates for users. Each user needs both a private key and an up-to-date certificate to decrypt ciphertexts. In the previous concrete constructions of CBE, the CA is assumed to be honest-but-curious, that is, the CA always starts launching attacks only after it has initialized the system honestly. However, it seems that such an assumption does not necessarily reflect reality when we consider a malicious CA that is trying every effort to break the system. To show that the malicious CA attack exists in CBE, we present two concrete attacks against a previous CBE scheme. In both attacks, a malicious CA can easily break any user's confidentiality by implanting a trapdoor in the public system parameters. To fight against malicious CA attacks, we propose a new CBE scheme. The proposed CBE scheme is proven to be chosen-ciphertext secure against malicious CA attacks in the standard model. Performance comparison shows that it is efficient and practical.","Chosen-ciphertext security, Certificate-based encryption, Malicious ca attack, Public key cryptography, Standard model","",""

Certificateless signatures were introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson to solve this key escrow problem of identity-based signatures in 2003. In certificateless signatures, the private key is determined by neither the user nor the KGC. In 2007, Huang et al. revisited the security models of certificateless signatures. They divided potential adversaries according to their attack power into normal, strong and super adversaries. On the other hand, Au et al. introduced a new attack called malicious-but-passive KGC attack in the same year.

We present some possible threats to ADOPT and suggest the use of a trust assessment and establishment framework, named ad hoc trust framework (ATF), to support ADOPT's robustness and efficiency. ADOPT is deployed as a trust-aware application that provides feedback to ATF, which calculates the trustworthiness of the peer nodes' functions and helps ADOPT to improve its performance by rapidly locating valid certificate status information. Moreover, we introduce the TrustSpan algorithm to reduce the overhead that ATF produces, and the TrustPath algorithm to identify and use trusted routes for propagating sensitive information, such as third parties' accusations. Simulation results show that ATF adds limited overhead compared to its efficiency in detecting and isolating malicious and selfish nodes.

Vision Transformer (ViT), a successful and well-known variant, attracts considerable attention from both industry and academia thanks to its record-breaking performance in various vision tasks. However, ViT is also highly nonlinear like other classical neural networks and could be easily fooled by both natural and adversarial perturbations. This limitation could pose a threat to the deployment of ViT in the real industrial environment, especially in safety-critical scenarios. How to improve the robustness of ViT is thus an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. Among all kinds of robustness, patch robustness is defined as giving a reliable output when a random patch in the input domain is perturbed. The perturbation could be natural corruption, such as part of the camera lens being blurred. It could also be a distribution shift, such as an object that does not exist in the training data suddenly appearing in the camera. And in the worst case, there could be a malicious adversarial patch attack that aims to fool the prediction of a machine learning model by arbitrarily modifying pixels within a restricted region of an input image. This kind of attack is also called physical attack as it is believed to be more real than digital attack. Although there has been some work on patch robustness improvement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), related studies on its counterpart ViT are still at an early stage as ViT is usually much more complex with far more parameters. It is harder to assess and improve its robustness, not to mention to provide a provable guarantee. In this work, we propose PatchCensor, aiming to certify the patch robustness of ViT by applying exhaustive testing. We try to provide a provable guarantee by considering the worst patch attack scenarios. Unlike empirical defenses against adversarial patches that may be adaptively breached, certified robust approaches can provide a certified accuracy against arbitrary attacks under certain conditions. However, existing robustness certifications are mostly based on robust training, which often requires substantial training efforts and the sacrifice of model performance on normal samples. To bridge the gap, PatchCensor seeks to improve the robustness of the whole system by detecting abnormal inputs instead of training a robust model and asking it to give reliable results for every input, which may inevitably compromise accuracy. Specifically, each input is tested by voting over multiple inferences with different mutated attention masks, where at least one inference is guaranteed to exclude the abnormal patch. This can be seen as complete-coverage testing, which could provide a statistical guarantee on inference at the test time. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PatchCensor is able to achieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel adversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques while achieving similar clean accuracy (81.8% on ImageNet). The clean accuracy is the same as vanilla ViT models.

In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collaborative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in online tests. The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating.","education, mooc, cheating detection, human computer interaction, machine learning, crowdsourcing","","CSCW '15"

First, we show that the original seven-algorithm definition is equivalent to a simplified five-algorithm definition. We believe that this simplified definition may lead to more compact and efficient implementations in practice and also help in the effort of standardisation of CLE. Secondly, we show that a CLE scheme cannot be both malicious Key Generation Center (KGC) secure and strongly secure in the standard model. Due to the practicality and attacking significance of malicious KGC security; and the uncertainty of how practical the strong security is, we, therefore, suggest constructing practical CLE schemes to be malicious KGC secure.

Pinning can provide enhanced security to defend against malicious third-party access to sensitive data in transit (e.g., to protect sensitive banking and health care information), but can also hide an app's personal data collection from users and auditors. Prior studies found pinning was rarely used in the Android ecosystem, except in high-profile, security-sensitive apps; and, little is known about its usage on iOS and across mobile platforms.In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the use of certificate pinning on Android and iOS. We collect 5,079 unique apps from the two official app stores: 575 common apps, 1,000 popular apps each, and 1,000 randomly selected apps each. We develop novel, cross-platform, static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect the usage of certificate pinning. Thus, our study offers a more comprehensive understanding of certificate pinning than previous studies.We find certificate pinning as much as 4 times more widely adopted than reported in recent studies. More specifically, we find that 0.9% to 8% of Android apps and 2.5% to 11% of iOS apps use certificate pinning at run time (depending on the aforementioned sets of apps). We then investigate which categories of apps most frequently use pinning (e.g., apps in the ""finance"" category), which destinations are typically pinned (e.g., first-party destinations vs those used by third-party libraries), which certificates are pinned and how these are pinned (e.g., CA vs leaf certificates), and the connection security for pinned connections vs unpinned ones (e.g., the use of weak ciphers or improper certificate validation). Lastly, we investigate how many pinned connections are amenable to binary instrumentation to reveal the contents of their connections; for those that are, we analyze the data sent over pinned connections to understand what is protected by pinning.","app pinning, certificate pinning, measurement techniques, transport layer security, network security, tls","","IMC '22"

However, in all the previously proposed certificateless schemes, it is always assumed that the malicious KGC starts launching attacks (so-called Type II attacks) only after it has generated a master public/secret key pair honestly. In this paper, we propose new security models that remove this assumption for both certificateless signature and encryption schemes.

Our idea is to use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal smart phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the owner of the device and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks and Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol that works well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the network that tries to use the stolen credentials in the social community of the original device that has been cloned. Community Certificates works well when the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen credentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social network from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an excellent protection against this very strong attack.

For example, malicious domains' certificates issued by compromised CAs are widespread, and revoked certificates are still trusted by clients. In spite of a lot of research to improve the security of SSL/TLS connections, there are still some problems unsolved. On one hand, although log-based schemes provided certificate audit service to quickly detect CAs' misbehavior, the security and data consistency of log servers are ignored. On the other hand, revoked certificates checking is neglected due to the incomplete, insecure and inefficient certificate revocation mechanisms. Further, existing revoked certificates checking schemes are centralized which would bring safety bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based public and efficient audit scheme for TLS connections, which is called Certchain. Specially, we propose a dependability-rank based consensus protocol in our blockchain system and a new data structure to support certificate forward traceability. Furthermore, we present a method that utilizes dual counting bloom filter (DCBF) with eliminating false positives to achieve economic space and efficient query for certificate revocation checking.

To do this, a signer must incorporate the verifier's public key with the signing procedure such that only the intended receiver could verify this signature with his/her private key. Such a signature further enables a designated verifier to simulate a computationally indistinguishable transcript intended for himself. Consequently, no one can identify the real signer's identity from a candidate signer and a designated verifier, which is referred to as the property of signer ambiguity. A strong notion of signer ambiguity states that no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish the real signer of a given SDVS that is not received by the designated verifier, even if the adversary has obtained the signer's private key. In 2013, Islam and Biswas proposed a provably secure certificateless strong designated verifier signature (CL-SDVS) scheme based on bilinear pairings. In this paper, we will demonstrate that their scheme fails to satisfy strong signer ambiguity and must assume a trusted private key generator (PKG). In other words, their CL-SDVS scheme is vulnerable to both key-compromise and malicious PKG attacks.

Furthermore, the mobility functions, such as routing, connection's decisions and security managements, are performed by the nodes themselves independently. Therefore, the security problem for mobile ad hoc networks is becoming one of the major issues that need to be solved.

However, the private key escrow problem of these schemes makes them unsuitable in practical environments because the private key generator computes signer private key using signer public identity. Therefore, an untrusted/semitrusted private key generator may perform malicious activity on behalf of the signer. We took the advantage of certificateless public key cryptography and constructed a robust and efficient certificateless blind signature CL-BS scheme using bilinear pairing. Furthermore, the probabilistic map-to-point hash function, which requires more computation time than the execution time of an elliptic curve scalar point multiplication, is circumvented in our scheme. We found that our scheme is unlinkable and provably secure against the adaptive chosen message and identity adversaries. From the perspective of computational costs, our scheme is more efficient and secure than other related schemes.

Broadcast signcryption, which enables the broadcaster to simultaneously encrypt and sign the content meant for a specific set of users in a single logical step, provides the most efficient solution to this dual problem of confidentiality and authentication. In this paper, we first construct a certificate less broadcast signcryption scheme and show that the proposed scheme is secure against an uncertified user and a malicious trusted authority simultaneously under the Diffie-Hellman assumptions in the random oracle. Moreover, our scheme satisfies register authentication and forward secrecy security attributes. As compared with the recently proposed broadcast signcryption schemes, our scheme has better performance in term of the security and computation overheads.","random oracle, broadcast signcryption, certificateless cryptography, forward secrecy","","CIS '11"

In this paper, we study forged certificates in the wild based on a long term large scale passive measurement. With the combination of certificate transparency (CT) logs and our measurement results, nearly 3 million forged certificates against the Alexa Top 10K sites are identified and studied. Our analysis reveals the causes and preference of forged certificates, as well as several significant differences from the benign ones. Finally, we discover several IP addresses used for MITM attacks by forged certificate tracing and deep behavior analysis. We believe our study can definitely contribute to research on SSL/TLS security as well as real world protocol usage.","SSL MITM, Forged certificate, Passive measurement","",""

There have been some certificateless signcryption schemes proposed in the standard model up to now, but all of them are just proposed in a weaker Type I security model, which is weaker than the original security model of Barbosa and Farshim, who proposed the first certificateless signcryption scheme. In this paper, we propose a certificateless signcryption scheme in the standard model by using bilinear pairings, which is Type I secure in the original security model of Barbosa and Farshim and can resist the malicious-but-passive key generation center Type II attack. The proposed scheme is proved confidential assuming the modified decisional bilinear Diffie---Hellman (M-DBDH) problem is hard, and unforgeable assuming the square computational Diffie---Hellman (Squ-CDH) problem is hard. At last, we evaluate its efficiency which shows it is of high efficiency.","Certificateless signcryption, Bilinear pairing, 94A60, Signcryption, Standard model, Malicious-but-passive KGC attack","",""

In this model, the system remains secure even in the presence of a certain threshold t of corrupted/malicious nodes.In this paper, we show how to perform necessary public key operations without node-specific certificates in ad hoc networks. These operations include pair-wise key establishment, signing, and encryption. We achieve this by using Feldman's verifiable polynomial secret sharing (VSS) as a key distribution scheme and treating the secret shares as the private keys. Unlike in the standard public key cryptography, where entities have independent private/public key pairs, in the proposed scheme the private keys are related (they are points on a polynomial of degree t) and each public key can be computed from the public VSS information and node identifier. We show that such related keys can still be securely used for standard signature and encryption operations (using resp. Schnorr signatures and ElGamal encryption) and for pairwise key establishment, as long as there are no more that t collusions/corruptions in the system.The proposed usage of shares as private keys can also be viewed as a threshold-tolerant identity-based cryptosystem under standard (discrete logarithm based) assumptions.","","","ACNS'06"

However, the lack of a clear in-depth defense line in such a new networking paradigm would make its potential users worry about the leakage of their private information, especially to those unauthenticated or even malicious adversaries. In this paper, we present a pair of efficient and light-weight authentication protocols to enable remote WBAN users to anonymously enjoy healthcare service. In particular, our authentication protocols are rooted with a novel certificateless signature (CLS) scheme, which is computational, efficient, and provably secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message attack in the random oracle model. Also, our designs ensure that application or service providers have no privilege to disclose the real identities of users. Even the network manager, which serves as private key generator in the authentication protocols, is prevented from impersonating legitimate users. The performance of our designs is evaluated through both theoretic analysis and experimental simulations, and the comparative studies demonstrate that they outperform the existing schemes in terms of better trade-off between desirable security properties and computational overhead, nicely meeting the needs of WBANs.","wireless body area network, healthcare, certificateless signature, Anonymous authentication","",""
