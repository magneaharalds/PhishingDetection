The IoV requires an efficient communication mode when the application scenarios are complicated. To reduce the verifying time and cut the length of signature, certificateless aggregate signature (CL-AS) is used to achieve improved performance in resource-constrained environments like vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which is able to make it effective in environments constrained by bandwidth and storage. However, in the real application scenarios, messages should be kept untamed, unleashed, and authentic. In addition, most of the proposed schemes tend to be easy to attack by signers or malicious entities which can be called coalition attack. In this paper, we present an improved certificateless-based authentication and aggregate signature scheme, which can properly solve the coalition attack. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only uses pseudonyms in communications to prevent vehicles from revealing their identity but also achieves considerable efficiency compared with state-of-the-art work, certificateless signature (CLS), and CL-AS schemes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that when focused on the existential forgery on adaptive chosen message attack and coalition attack, the proposed schemes can be proved secure. Also, we show that our scheme exceeds existing certification schemes in both computing and communication costs.","","","",""

As a consequence, the simple user advice to check whether a website is HTTPSprotected is no longer effective against phishing. At the same time, the use of certificates in the context of phishing raises the question if the information contained in them could be used to detect phishing websites. In this paper we take a first step towards answering this question. To this end, we analyze almost 10 000 valid certificates queried from phishing websites and compare them to almost 40 000 certificates collected from benign sites. Our analysis shows that it is generally impossible to differentiate between benign sites and phishing sites based on the content of their certificates alone. However, we present empirical evidence that current phishing websites for popular targets do typically not replicate the issuer and subject information.","","","","SOUPS'19"

Still PKI ensures a secure method for exchanging sensitive information over unsecured channels through the use of cryptographic public private key pair, issued by Certification Authority CA but even an honest CA can issue forged certificate. Now in India everything is digitalized to enable e-Governance. For that a unique identity, aadhar number issued by Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI is most widely used. For avoiding fraudulent certificates, strong authentication and attacks on CAs, the authors proposed an algorithm that use multiple signature on certificate based on aadhar number offered by UIDAI for online entity authentication-verification before issuing the certificate. If any of the CA is compromised whether its database or key will not be able to issue certificate to any server as authentication fails and multiple signatures are required.

Besides, 5G-enabled vehicular networks also provide infotainment services and industry application services. High-strength data transmission, however, will bring a serious burden of resource overhead, and there are hidden dangers of security and privacy in the communication process of vehicular networks. Some current vehicular network authentication schemes adopt public key infrastructure-based (PKI-based) and identity-based authentication methods to achieve conditional privacy preservation. Still, these schemes are too expensive and cannot address the problems of costly certificate management or risky key escrow. Some schemes use computationally complex bilinear pairing operations that result in low efficiency and do not consider the revocation of malicious nodes so that they cannot effectively prevent further malicious attacks. This paper proposes a lightweight certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme with a revocation mechanism suitable for 5G-enabled vehicular networks in response to the above problems. Our proposed scheme uses aggregation signature technology to aggregate multiple signatures into a single short signature, thus reducing communication overhead and storage overhead of road side units (RSUs). Furthermore, our proposed scheme utilizes the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to reduce verification time and computational overhead. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious users from sending invalid signatures to attack, our proposed scheme uses binary search to identify invalid signatures and introduces a cuckoo filter to revoke malicious users to prevent reattack. Finally, formal proof and experimental analysis show that our proposed scheme has greater advantages with respect to security and efficiency compared with the previous schemes.","","","",""

However, for various reasons, Android developers fail to properly implement SSL/TLS during the development of an app, resulting in security risks. The improper implementations include trusting all certificates, trusting all domain names, or ignoring certificate verification errors. These improper implementations may result in Man-In-The-Middle(MITM) attacks or phishing attacks. In this work, we are motivated to detect vulnerabilities in implementation of SSL/TLS in Android apps by designing and implementing a tool called DCDroid (Detecting SSL/TLS Certificate verification vulnerabilities in Android apps) with the combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis. We focus on four types of vulnerable schema and locate the potential vulnerable code snippets in apps with static analysis. In dynamic analysis, we prioritize the triggering of User Interface(UI) components based on the results with static analysis to confirm the misuse of SSL/TLS. The dynamic analysis benefits from the static analysis and removes false positives. With DCDroid we analyze 960 apps from Google Play and 1253 apps from 360app. The experimental results show that 457 (20.65%) apps contain potential security risks in the implementation of SSL/TLS. Guided by the static analysis, we further confirm that 248 (11.21%) out of 2213 apps are truly vulnerable to MITM and phishing attacks. By analyzing the categories, ranks and version evolution of these detected vulnerable apps, we find that apps of News&Books are more likely to introduce SSL/TLS risks. We also find that the fix cycle of the risk is very long. We provide suggestions on SSL/TLS certificate verification to Android developers in order to deal with the SSL/TLS certificate verification vulnerabilities.","MITM, Android security, static analysis, dynamic analysis, SSL/TLS","","","ACM TURC '19"

A major part of IoT systems comprises of resource-constrained devices, with less margin in memory and computation capabilities to embed sophisticated security solutions. Hence, hardware-based TEEs provide resource-efficient remedies to known attack vectors with reduced software attack surface. In this dissertation, we identified challenges cropping up from the heterogeneity of the IoT infrastructure, that hindered the adoption of TEEs in resource-constrained IoT. We ultimately approach the security of IoT devices through automated certification with hardware-rooted assurance guarantees. The contributions of this dissertation are made through six research papers addressing these challenges. TEEs provide hardware-supported mechanisms to create secure areas to store sensitive data and execute critical software. However, the secure areas lack a secure way to communicate with the rest of the system. Moreover, once a software is placed in the secure areas, it becomes extremely difficult to detect and trace misbehaviour. To this end, we contribute frameworks that strengthen the functionality of TrustZone-M, which is ARM's TEE designed for resource-constrained IoT. The addition of a secure communication channel in TrustZone-M enabled IoT devices guarantees confidentiality and integrity of shared data between the system applications and the secure areas even in case of a compromised OS. In addition, our contribution to the TrustZone-M secure areas to enable monitoring and blocking of malicious behaviour by applications, adds protection in the presence of untrusted third-party critical software.Secondly, we propose an automated digital certification of IoT devices by combining the Public Key Infrastructure standard authentication mechanisms with attributes of software assurance. The resultant process and the certificate is compliant with standards, bearing potential for seamless integration into existing and forthcoming IoT standards and incorporates assurance guarantees with minimal addition to the existing digital certificate.Lastly, we contribute a software update architecture based on well-vetted standards, proposing token-based access control. The architecture relies on a compact message encoding format to encode the software manifests, providing authorized updates while ensuring small code and message sizes suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. The experimental evaluations of the proposed solutions in well-defined IoT use-cases, reveal the feasibility of their integration in existing devices with minimal effort. Furthermore, the performance analysis in each case, demonstrates execution overhead at par with system operations. The overall contribution of this dissertation advances the security of resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, with substantial impact in the academic and industrial community. Since TrustZone-M and TPM 2.0 are in the preliminary stages of adoption in the IoT domain, these enhancements and contributions are well-timed for efficient integration, while looking forward to the effective pay-off in the near future.","","AAI30285452","Ph.D. Thesis",""

However, at present, the speed of vehicle certification in IoV is slow, and the use of idle resources is not considered. To address this problem, this paper provides a blockchain-based vehicle identity verification scheme by using a hybrid identity code verification method to ensure the nodes in the network securely share information. Meanwhile, a task processing algorithm based on time window is proposed to optimize the utilization of idle resources. In addition, the method is evaluated by simulation experiment, and the designed scheme can reduce malicious behavior of a registered vehicle in the network, and can shorten the processing task delay.","Internet of Vehicle (IoV), Blockchian, Task assignment, Certification mechanism","","",""

Several methods and hazard analysis, and standards in different disciplines, have been defined in order to assure the systems have been designed in compliance with safety requirements. The increasing presence of automatic controlling operation, the massive use of networks to transfer data and information, and the human operations introduce a new security concern in safety-critical systems. Security issues (threats) do not only have direct impact on systems availability, integrity and confidentiality, but they also can influence the safety aspects of the safety critical systems. Today taking into account malicious actions through intrusion into communications and computer control systems become a critical and not negligible step during the design and the assessment of safety-critical systems. The paper describes a general methodology to support the assessment of safety-critical system with respect to security aspects. The methodology is based on a library of security threats. Such threats, identified during the work, have been mapped to the NIST security controls. Then, a preliminary representation of the library in the aerospace domain is shown through some simple example, together with some considerations on the relation between security issues and safety impact as a valuable addition to the safety critical systems certification process.","Threats Library, Safety, Safety-critical system, Security, Cyber Threats","","","ISSREW '14"

Our model uses a collaborative reputation based on rating the subject business applying for a certification and the number of transactions conducted with the business as well as the reputation of the raters. In addition, it employs a clustering technique to determine the honesty of raters and to implement a reward-penalty approach.
