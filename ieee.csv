Because phishing domains generally have a very short lifetime to avoid detection, they must be identified as soon as possible to prevent damage. In general, phishers frequently reassign resources, such as domain names and IP addresses, to avoid detection. Consequently, multiple domains may be hosted by the same IP address, or vice versa. Furthermore, phishing websites often employ certificates and HTTPS encryption to appear more trustworthy. In this study, we focused on HTTPS-enabled phishing websites to construct and analyze DNS graphs of domain names and IP addresses of phishing websites using Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. From the analysis results, we examined the differences between benign and phishing websites in terms of the number of nodes per component and average node degree.","1738-9445","979-11-88428-10-6","10.23919/ICACT56868.2023.10079566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10079566","Phishing;DNS;DNS Graph;Security","Measurement;Phishing;Time series analysis;Complex networks;Communications technology;Encryption;IP networks","computer crime;computer network security;cryptography;graph theory;Internet;IP networks;resource allocation;Web sites","certificate transparency logs;digital certificates;DNS graph;DNS graph analysis;HTTPS encryption;IP address;phishing threats;phishing websites","","","","14","","29 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include: (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites with low false positives and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs.","","978-1-7281-8597-2","10.1109/EuroSPW51379.2020.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229674","Phishing;HTTPS;Public-Key Certificate","Phishing;Servers;Monitoring;Electronic mail;Registers;Public key;Logic gates","computer crime;computer network security;digital signatures;hypermedia;Internet;public key cryptography;transport protocols;unsolicited e-mail;Web sites","public-key certificate;certificate-based detection;phishing attacks;unknown phishing websites;HTTPSified phishing websites;TLS certificates footprints;HTTPS adoption;intrinsic footprints;dynamic DNS;domain-registration-based approach;website phishing detection;hosting services;Internet;certificate transparency;domain names;clustering analysis;certificate authorities","","1","","45","IEEE","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, this serves as an important complement to the existing server-based anti-phishing mechanisms which predominately use blacklists. Blacklisting suffers from several inherent drawbacks in terms of correctness, timeliness, and completeness. Due to the potentially significant lag prior to site blacklisting, there is a window of opportunity for attackers. Other local client-side phishing detection approaches also exist, but primarily rely on page content or URLs, which are arguably easier to manipulate by attackers. We illustrate that our certificate-based approach greatly increases the difficulty of masquerading undetected for phishers, with single millisecond delays for users. We further show that this approach works not only against HTTPS-enabled phishing attacks, but also detects HTTP phishing attacks with port 443 enabled.","2159-1245","978-1-4799-8909-6","10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120795","certificates;machine learning;security","Feature extraction;Electronic mail;Browsers;Public key;Uniform resource locators;Servers","computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);public key cryptography;Web sites","Web site phishing detection;public key certificate;machine-learning approach from;HTTPS-enabled phishing attack;server-based antiphishing mechanism;site blacklisting","","33","1","38","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a promising Android malware detection scheme, we focus on the scheme leveraging the differences of traffic patterns between benign apps and malware. Those differences can be captured even if the packet is encrypted. However, since such features are just statistic based ones, they cannot identify whether each traffic is malicious. Thus, it is necessary to design the scheme which is applicable to encrypted traffic data and supports identification of malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection scheme based on the level of SSL server certificate. Attackers tend to use an untrusted certificate to encrypt malicious payloads in many cases because passing rigorous examination is required to get a trusted certificate. Thus, we utilize SSL server certificate based features for detection since their certificates tend to be untrusted. Furthermore, in order to obtain the more exact features, we introduce required permission based weight values because malware inevitably require permissions regarding malicious actions. By computer simulation with real dataset, we show our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.7 %. True positive rate and false positive rate are 5.6% higher and 3.3% lower than the previous scheme, respectively. Our scheme can cope with encrypted malicious payloads and 89 malware which are not detected by the previous scheme.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013483","","Malware;Servers;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Androids;Humanoid robots;Payloads","computer network security;cryptography;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","benign apps;encrypted malicious payloads;permission based weight values;untrusted certificate;malicious traffic;encrypted traffic data;traffic patterns;promising Android malware detection scheme;SSL server certificate","","1","","18","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to previous works that consider this a binary classification problem, we take into account that a certificate can be partially benign and phishy simultaneously. We propose a multi-class classifier and a regressor to classify these ambiguous certificates, in addition to benign and phishing certificates, where the ‘phishyness’ of a certificate is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 for the regressor. We apply our method to a set of certificates obtained from certificate transparency logs and show that we can classify them with high performance. We extend our validation by evaluating the performance of the model over time, showing that our model generalizes over time on our training data set.","1976-7684","978-1-6654-1332-9","10.1109/ICOIN53446.2022.9687264","Innovation Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687264","Digital Certificate;Phishing;Machine Learning;Feature Extraction","Training;Phishing;Web pages;Training data;Machine learning;Data models;Browsers","computer crime;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);online front-ends;pattern classification;unsolicited e-mail;Web sites","certificate transparency logs;phishing attacks;HTTPS;phishing Web page;user browser;malicious purpose;digital certificates;data features;machine learning;binary classification problem;multiclass classifier;regressor;benign certificates;ambiguous phishing certificate detection;ambiguous certificate classification;TLS","","1","","20","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the foreseen impact of VANETs, extensive studies in both academia and industry fields has been made, which emphasizes on effective VANETs implementations. In practical VANETs scenarios with open wireless communication characteristics, enhanced security strategies should be deployed in order to guarantee transmission safety. Moreover, individual vehicle needs to perform pre-defined authentication process toward all the acquired messages, some of which may be generated by abnormal devices or malicious attackers. In this case, with large amounts of anomaly messages to be authenticated during a relatively short time period, the denial of service (DoS) attack is possible. Note that the vehicle has limited computation capability and restrained storage. In this paper, we address the above issues by developing a secure and efficient authentication scheme with unsupervised anomaly detection. In our design, certificateless authentication technique is deployed for conditional privacy preserving, along with the Chinese remainder theorem for efficient group key distribution and dynamic updating. Subsequently, the corresponding unsupervised anomaly detection method is illustrated, which applies dynamic time warping for distance measurement. The proposed method could remarkably alleviate unnecessary authentication burden in vehicle side. DoS attack can also be prevented in this way. Furthermore, anomaly detection method is conducted by the involving road side units (RSUs), while the contents of the processing traffic flows are kept secret to RSUs during the entire process. Security analysis shows that our scheme can achieve desired security properties. Additionally, performance analysis demonstrates that our design is efficient compared with state-of-the-art.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883426","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1D1A3B03034005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550637","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);certificateless authentication;unsupervised learning;anomaly detection;dynamic time warping (DTW)","Authentication;Anomaly detection;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Wireless communication;Protocols;Vehicle dynamics","cryptography;intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","secure authentication scheme;intelligent transportation system;vehicular ad hoc networks;transmission safety;malicious attackers;certificateless authentication technique;DoS attack;security analysis;VANET;wireless communication;denial of service attack;authentication scheme;group key distribution;unsupervised anomaly detection method;authentication burden;certificateless authentication scheme;Chinese remainder theorem;road side units","","40","","48","OAPA","28 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This transparency inevitably leaks the privacy of identity owners (IdOs) through the identity information bound in certificates. In response to the privacy leakage, several privacy-preserving schemes have been proposed that transform/hash/encrypt the privacy-carrying part in certificates. However, these certificates conceal identity while also making it opaque to the IdO, which defeats the purpose of CT. To address the contradiction between transparency and privacy, we propose Semi-CT, a semi-transparency mechanism that makes the certificates transparent to IdOs but opaque to snoopers. Inspired by public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS), Semi-CT based on bilinear pairing enables trapdoor-holding IdOs to retrieve certificates associated with their identity. Semi-CT also addresses protocol deviation detection and trapdoor protection in the malicious model. Finally, through theoretical and experimental analysis, we prove the security and feasibility of Semi-CT for practical applications.","2642-7389","979-8-3503-0048-2","10.1109/ISCC58397.2023.10217862","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002011); Youth Top Talent Support Program of Beihang University(grant numbers:YWF-22-L-1272); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10217862","PKI;Certificate Transparency;Privacy Protection;Information Leakage;Label Redaction;Bilinear Pairing","Computers;Privacy;Protocols;Keyword search;Public key;Recording;Encryption","","","","","","29","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the process of utilizing conventional certificates, it is possible to leak sensitive information of the corporation. For example, certificate data traffic in the smart grid may expose important nodes and current security management level of a certain grid-related network. Therefore, a solution is required to evaluate the data of the grid-related network at the certificate level in a secure and efficient manner. This study provides a certificate-based enterprise privacy analysis and anomaly detection scheme. Using SSL/TLS and X.509 as standards, the scheme extracts valid certificate information by collecting certificate data traffic between enterprise networks and analyzing the certificate data. The scheme monitors and analyzes the flow of certificate data for the grid network, identifies suspicious anomalous behaviors and invalid certificates, and warns of risky behavior. By monitoring certificate data flow, it is feasible to improve the enterprise authentication framework and business communication method, prevent the leaking of enterprise privacy data.","","979-8-3503-4655-8","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-ScalCom-DigitalTwin-PriComp-Metaverse56740.2022.00330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189494","SSL/ TLS;X.509;certificate;privacy analysis","Business communication;Privacy;Data privacy;Security management;Authentication;Behavioral sciences;Smart grids","authorisation;business communication;computer network security;cryptography;data communication;data privacy;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security","anomaly discovery;business collaboration;business communication;certificate authentication;certificate data;certificate-based enterprise privacy analysis;data communication;ecurity assurance;enterprise privacy data;grid-related network;SSL;TLS;X.509 standards","","","","19","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The widely used encryption transmission protocols, such as the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols, leads to the failure of traditional payload-based classification methods. Existing methods for encrypted traffic classification suffer from low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a certificate-aware encrypted traffic classification method based on the Second-Order Markov Chain. We start by exploring reasons why existing methods not perform well, and make a novel observation that certificate packet length in SSL/TLS sessions contributes to application discrimination. To increase the diversity of application fingerprints, we develop a new model by incorporating the certificate packet length clustering into the Second-Order homogeneous Markov chains. Extensive evaluation results show that the proposed method lead to a 30% improvement on average compared with the state-of-the-art method, in terms of classification accuracy.","","978-1-5090-2634-0","10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590451","","Markov processes;Protocols;Servers;Ciphers;Ports (Computers);Encryption","computer network management;cryptographic protocols;Markov processes;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","certificate-aware encrypted traffic classification;second-order Markov chain;network management;malicious attack detection;encryption transmission protocols;secure socket layer protocol;transport layer security protocol","","3","","21","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fault tolerant control computes a control signal with the remaining estimations at each time step.
