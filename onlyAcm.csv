polict: flexible policy in certificate transparency enabling lightweight self-monitor,"Sun A,Li B,Wan H,Wang Q","Applied Cryptography and Network Security Workshops: ACNS 2021 Satellite Workshops, AIBlock, AIHWS, AIoTS, CIMSS, Cloud S&P, SCI, SecMT, and SiMLA, Kamakura, Japan, June 21–24, 2021, Proceedings",2021,10.1007/978-3-030-81645-2_21,"Certificate Transparency (CT) is proposed to detect maliciously or mistakenly issued certificates by recording all certificates in publicly-visible logs. CT assumes that any individual can undertake the role of a CT monitor which fetches all the certificates in the logs and discovers suspicious ones from them. However, studies in recent years shows that ordinary individuals have to pay an unbearable price to operate a monitor by themselves, which makes the originally distributed trust be concentrated on several third-party monitors. Unfortunately, some researches indicate that problems of timeliness, security, and reliability exist in third-party monitors. In this paper, we propose the PoliCT, a flexible and customizable certificate transparency management solution where domain owners can designate how their certificates should be submitted and validated. It enables domain owners (a) to release their CT policies to monitor a few logs purposefully, thereby greatly reducing monitoring costs; (b) to demand more SCTs to increase the transparency of their certificates. After that, we discuss the design of a reliable lightweight self-monitor in detail. Expectably, the actual data collection and the theoretical analysis of the prototype system show that PoliCT enables a common individual to maintain its CT policies with negligible overhead, and significantly improves the performance of monitoring service."
certificate transparency in the wild: exploring the reliability of monitors,"Li B,Lin J,Li F,Wang Q,Li Q,Jing J,Wang C",Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2019,10.1145/3319535.3345653,"To detect fraudulent TLS server certificates and improve the accountability of certification authorities (CAs), certificate transparency (CT) is proposed to record certificates in publicly-visible logs, from which the monitors fetch all certificates and watch for suspicious ones. However, if the monitors, either domain owners themselves or third-party services, fail to return a complete set of certificates issued for a domain of interest, potentially fraudulent certificates may not be detected and then the CT framework becomes less reliable. This paper presents the first systematic study on CT monitors. We analyze the data in 88 public logs and the services of 5 active third-party monitors regarding 3,000,431 certificates of 6,000 selected Alexa Top-1M websites. We find that although CT allows ordinary domain owners to act as monitors, it is impractical for them to perform reliable processing by themselves, due to the rapidly increasing volume of certificates in public logs (e.g., on average 5 million records or 28.29 GB daily for the minimal set of logs that need to be monitored). Moreover, our study discloses that (a) none of the third-party monitors guarantees to return the complete set of certificates for a domain, and (b) for some domains, even the union of the certificates returned by the five third-party monitors can probably be incomplete. As a result, the certificates accepted by CT-enabled browsers are not absolutely visible to the claimed domain owners, even when CT is adopted with well-functioning logs. The risk of invisible fraudulent certificates in public logs raises doubts on the reliability of CT in practice."

a provably secure certificate-based encryption scheme against malicious ca attacks in the standard model,"Lu Y,Li J",,2016,10.1016/j.ins.2016.08.082,"Certificate-based encryption (CBE) is a new public-key cryptographic paradigm that represents an interesting balance between conventional public-key encryption and identity-based encryption. It not only simplifies the certificate revocation problem in conventional public-key encryption, but also solves the key escrow problem inherent in identity-based encryption. In CBE, a certificate authority (CA) is employed to initialize the system and issue certificates for users. Each user needs both a private key and an up-to-date certificate to decrypt ciphertexts. In the previous concrete constructions of CBE, the CA is assumed to be honest-but-curious, that is, the CA always starts launching attacks only after it has initialized the system honestly. However, it seems that such an assumption does not necessarily reflect reality when we consider a malicious CA that is trying every effort to break the system. To show that the malicious CA attack exists in CBE, we present two concrete attacks against a previous CBE scheme. In both attacks, a malicious CA can easily break any user's confidentiality by implanting a trapdoor in the public system parameters. To fight against malicious CA attacks, we propose a new CBE scheme. The proposed CBE scheme is proven to be chosen-ciphertext secure against malicious CA attacks in the standard model. Performance comparison shows that it is efficient and practical."
finding phish in a haystack: a pipeline for phishing classification on certificate transparency logs,"Drichel A,Drury V,von Brandt J,Meyer U","Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",2021,10.1145/3465481.3470111,"Current popular phishing prevention techniques mainly utilize reactive blocklists, which leave a “window of opportunity” for attackers during which victims are unprotected. One possible approach to shorten this window aims to detect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Previous attempts to work with CT log data for phishing classification exist, however they lack evaluations on actual CT log data. In this paper, we present a pipeline that facilitates such evaluations by addressing a number of problems when working with CT log data. The pipeline includes dataset creation, training, and past or live classification of CT logs. Its modular structure makes it possible to easily exchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling efforts and classifier comparisons. We test the pipeline on a number of new and existing classifiers, and find a general potential to improve classifiers for this scenario in the future. We publish the source code of the pipeline and the used datasets along with this paper [12], thus making future research in this direction more accessible."
security analysis of an enhanced certificateless signcryption in the standard model,Yuan Y,,2020,10.1007/s11277-020-07031-9,"Quite recently, Luo and Wan putted forward a new certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme with low computation cost in the standard model. They stated that their newly proposed scheme achieves the unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack (i.e, unforgeability) and indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (i.e., confidentiality). However, we find that the scheme cannot reach the claimed security feature. Specifically, in this paper, we will demonstrate that in Luo and Wan’s CLSC scheme, the plaintext can be easily recovered from the ciphertext by ordinary attacker and malicious-but-passive KGC. In addition, we identify that this scheme even cannot resist forgery attack of a malicious KGC."
ecdsa-based certificateless conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme in vehicular ad hoc network,"Imghoure A,El-Yahyaoui A,Omary F",,2022,10.1016/j.vehcom.2022.100504,
integrating a trust framework with a distributed certificate validation scheme for manets,"Marias GF,Papapanagiotou K,Tsetsos V,Sekkas O,Georgiadis P",,2006,10.1155/WCN/2006/78259,"Many trust establishment solutions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) rely on public key certificates. Therefore, they should be accompanied by an efficient mechanism for certificate revocation and validation. Ad hoc distributed OCSP for trust (ADOPT) is a lightweight, distributed, on-demand scheme based on cached OCSP responses, which provides certificate status information to the nodes of a MANET. In this paper we discuss the ADOPT scheme and issues on its deployment over MANETs. We present some possible threats to ADOPT and suggest the use of a trust assessment and establishment framework, named ad hoc trust framework (ATF), to support ADOPT's robustness and efficiency. ADOPT is deployed as a trust-aware application that provides feedback to ATF, which calculates the trustworthiness of the peer nodes' functions and helps ADOPT to improve its performance by rapidly locating valid certificate status information. Moreover, we introduce the TrustSpan algorithm to reduce the overhead that ATF produces, and the TrustPath algorithm to identify and use trusted routes for propagating sensitive information, such as third parties' accusations. Simulation results show that ATF adds limited overhead compared to its efficiency in detecting and isolating malicious and selfish nodes. ADOPT's reliability is increased, since it can rapidly locate a legitimate response by using information provided by ATF."
patchcensor: patch robustness certification for transformers via exhaustive testing,"Huang Y,Ma L,Li Y",,2023,10.1145/3591870,"In the past few years, Transformer has been widely adopted in many domains and applications because of its impressive performance. Vision Transformer (ViT), a successful and well-known variant, attracts considerable attention from both industry and academia thanks to its record-breaking performance in various vision tasks. However, ViT is also highly nonlinear like other classical neural networks and could be easily fooled by both natural and adversarial perturbations. This limitation could pose a threat to the deployment of ViT in the real industrial environment, especially in safety-critical scenarios. How to improve the robustness of ViT is thus an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. Among all kinds of robustness, patch robustness is defined as giving a reliable output when a random patch in the input domain is perturbed. The perturbation could be natural corruption, such as part of the camera lens being blurred. It could also be a distribution shift, such as an object that does not exist in the training data suddenly appearing in the camera. And in the worst case, there could be a malicious adversarial patch attack that aims to fool the prediction of a machine learning model by arbitrarily modifying pixels within a restricted region of an input image. This kind of attack is also called physical attack as it is believed to be more real than digital attack. Although there has been some work on patch robustness improvement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), related studies on its counterpart ViT are still at an early stage as ViT is usually much more complex with far more parameters. It is harder to assess and improve its robustness, not to mention to provide a provable guarantee. In this work, we propose PatchCensor, aiming to certify the patch robustness of ViT by applying exhaustive testing. We try to provide a provable guarantee by considering the worst patch attack scenarios. Unlike empirical defenses against adversarial patches that may be adaptively breached, certified robust approaches can provide a certified accuracy against arbitrary attacks under certain conditions. However, existing robustness certifications are mostly based on robust training, which often requires substantial training efforts and the sacrifice of model performance on normal samples. To bridge the gap, PatchCensor seeks to improve the robustness of the whole system by detecting abnormal inputs instead of training a robust model and asking it to give reliable results for every input, which may inevitably compromise accuracy. Specifically, each input is tested by voting over multiple inferences with different mutated attention masks, where at least one inference is guaranteed to exclude the abnormal patch. This can be seen as complete-coverage testing, which could provide a statistical guarantee on inference at the test time. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PatchCensor is able to achieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel adversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques while achieving similar clean accuracy (81.8% on ImageNet). The clean accuracy is the same as vanilla ViT models. Meanwhile, our technique also supports flexible configurations to handle different adversarial patch sizes by simply changing the masking strategy."
massive open online proctor: protecting the credibility of moocs certificates,"Li X,Chang KM,Yuan Y,Hauptmann A",Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing,2015,10.1145/2675133.2675245,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enable everyone to receive high-quality education. However, current MOOC creators cannot provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests, which would be required for any certification. In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collaborative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in online tests. The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating."
certificate‐based signature scheme in the standard model,"Zhou C,Cui Z",,2017,10.1049/iet-ifs.2016.0261,"Certificate‐based cryptosystem can eliminate the private key escrow problem inherent in the identity‐based cryptosystem and can simplify the costly certificate management in the traditional public key cryptosystem. In 2016, Lu et al. raised an open problem of whether the certificate‐based signature (CBS) scheme can be proved secure against the malicious‐but‐passive certifier attack. In this study, the authors try to solve this problem. They give an enhanced security model of the CBS scheme which can resist the malicious‐but‐passive certifier attack. Then they propose a concrete CBS scheme in the standard model by using bilinear pairings. They prove the scheme to be secure in the enhanced security model under the Squ‐CDH assumption. In this way, the authors give an affirmative answer to the above open problem. Finally, the authors evaluate the efficiency of the scheme which shows it to be practical. In addition, they find that malicious‐but‐passive certifier security cannot coexist with super adversary security in a CBS scheme in the standard model."
on the relation among various security models for certificateless cryptography,"Huang Q,Wong DS",,2008,10.1504/IJACT.2008.021084,"Certificateless cryptography is a promising technology for solving the key escrow problem in identity-based cryptography. However, the lack of a unified set of definitions and security models currently hinders its progression as much effort has been put on refining the definitions and looking for an appropriate and practical security models. In this article, we aim to contribute on unifying the definitions and security models for Certificateless Encryption (CLE) schemes. First, we show that the original seven-algorithm definition is equivalent to a simplified five-algorithm definition. We believe that this simplified definition may lead to more compact and efficient implementations in practice and also help in the effort of standardisation of CLE. Secondly, we show that a CLE scheme cannot be both malicious Key Generation Center (KGC) secure and strongly secure in the standard model. Due to the practicality and attacking significance of malicious KGC security; and the uncertainty of how practical the strong security is, we, therefore, suggest constructing practical CLE schemes to be malicious KGC secure. Finally, we propose to formalise a new adversarial capability called partial key replacement attack into the security models and show that our generic scheme proposed recently is secure against this new type of attacks."
a certificateless signature and group signature schemes against malicious pkg,"Zhang G,Wang S",Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications,2008,10.1109/AINA.2008.84,"Identity-based cryptosystem has many advantages over PKI-based cryptosystem in key distribution, but key escrow is always an inherent drawback. In order to solve the problem, certificateless public key cryptography was introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson in 8. In this paper, we first introduce a certificateless signature scheme secure against both malicious PKG attack and DODattack without random oracle, which is the first scheme satisfying theses properties in the literature. Based on the certificateless signature scheme, we also present a constant-size group signature scheme against malicious group manager."
cryptanalysis and improvement of a certificateless partially blind signature,"Cheng L,Wen Q",,2015,10.1049/iet-ifs.2014.0293,"Partially blind signature is an important technique in secure electronic cash (e‐cash) system. The first concrete certificateless partially blind signature (CLPBS) scheme for e‐cash was constructed in 2011. Recently it was found that this construction had a security weakness and a rescued scheme was given. Unfortunately, the formal security proof was not given. In this study, the authors first give cryptanalysis of their rescued scheme. They demonstrate that a malicious user in their rescued scheme can forge a signature on any message by replacing the signer's public key. In an e‐cash system, blind signatures issued by the bank are viewed as e‐cash. Once they apply their scheme to an untraceable e‐cash system, a malicious user can forge valid electronic coins (i.e. valid signatures) without being detected by the bank. It will result in loss of the bank. Then, they propose a newly improved CLPBS scheme which achieves the strongest security level and has higher computational efficiency than the rescued scheme published earlier. Finally, they give an example of potential application to e‐cash systems using their scheme."
a comparative analysis of certificate pinning in android & ios,"Pradeep A,Paracha MT,Bhowmick P,Davanian A,Razaghpanah A,Chung T,Lindorfer M,Vallina-Rodriguez N,Levin D,Choffnes D",Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Internet Measurement Conference,2022,10.1145/3517745.3561439,"TLS certificate pinning is a security mechanism used by applications (apps) to protect their network traffic against malicious certificate authorities (CAs), in-path monitoring, and other methods of TLS tampering. Pinning can provide enhanced security to defend against malicious third-party access to sensitive data in transit (e.g., to protect sensitive banking and health care information), but can also hide an app's personal data collection from users and auditors. Prior studies found pinning was rarely used in the Android ecosystem, except in high-profile, security-sensitive apps; and, little is known about its usage on iOS and across mobile platforms.In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the use of certificate pinning on Android and iOS. We collect 5,079 unique apps from the two official app stores: 575 common apps, 1,000 popular apps each, and 1,000 randomly selected apps each. We develop novel, cross-platform, static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect the usage of certificate pinning. Thus, our study offers a more comprehensive understanding of certificate pinning than previous studies.We find certificate pinning as much as 4 times more widely adopted than reported in recent studies. More specifically, we find that 0.9% to 8% of Android apps and 2.5% to 11% of iOS apps use certificate pinning at run time (depending on the aforementioned sets of apps). We then investigate which categories of apps most frequently use pinning (e.g., apps in the ""finance"" category), which destinations are typically pinned (e.g., first-party destinations vs those used by third-party libraries), which certificates are pinned and how these are pinned (e.g., CA vs leaf certificates), and the connection security for pinned connections vs unpinned ones (e.g., the use of weak ciphers or improper certificate validation). Lastly, we investigate how many pinned connections are amenable to binary instrumentation to reveal the contents of their connections; for those that are, we analyze the data sent over pinned connections to understand what is protected by pinning."
cryptanalysis and improvement of a certificateless encryption scheme in the standard model,"Cheng L,Wen Q,Jin Z,Zhang H",,2014,10.1007/s11704-013-3090-6,"Certificateless public key cryptography eliminates inherent key escrow problem in identity-based cryptography, and does not yet requires certificates as in the traditional public key infrastructure.

Their scheme is proved to be insecure even in a weaker security model called ""honest-but-curious"" KGC attack model.

improved certificate‐based signature scheme without random oracles,"Lu Y,Li J",,2016,10.1049/iet-ifs.2015.0188,"Certificate‐based cryptography is a useful primitive that combines traditional public key cryptography (PKC) and identity‐based cryptography (IBC). It not only solves the key escrow problem inherent in IBC, but also simplifies the certificate problem in traditional PKC. So far, several certificate‐based signature (CBS) schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, none of them consider the malicious certificate authority (CA) attack. Cryptanalysis shows that two previous CBS schemes without random oracles fail in achieving unforgeability under such attack. To overcome the security weakness in these schemes, the authors propose an improved CBS scheme that can withstand malicious CA attacks. They prove it to be existentially unforgeable against chosen message attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption in the standard model. Compared with the previous standard‐model CBS schemes, the proposed scheme has obvious advantages in both the computation and communication efficiency."

He et al. Pointed out that Xiong et al.'s scheme is insecure against the Type II adversary. But, their forged signatures are not random, and their improved scheme has the same security defects as Xiong et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we present two malicious-but-passive KGC attack methods on Xiong et al.'s scheme and our results show that their scheme is insecure against malicious-but-passive KGC attack. We also propose an improved scheme which is secure against the super Type I adversary and super Type II adversary."
malicious kgc attacks in certificateless cryptography,"Au MH,Mu Y,Chen J,Wong DS,Liu JK,Yang G","Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security",2007,10.1145/1229285.1266997,"Identity-based cryptosystems have an inherent key escrow issue, that is, the Key Generation Center (KGC) always knows user secret key. If the KGC is malicious, it can always impersonate the user. Certificateless cryptography, introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson in 2003, is intended to solve this problem. However, in all the previously proposed certificateless schemes, it is always assumed that the malicious KGC starts launching attacks (so-called Type II attacks) only after it has generated a master public/secret key pair honestly. In this paper, we propose new security models that remove this assumption for both certificateless signature and encryption schemes. Under the new models, we show that a class of certificateless encryption and signature schemes proposed previously are insecure. These schemes still suffer from the key escrow problem. On the other side, we also give new proofs to show that there are two generic constructions, one for certificateless signature and the other for certificateless encryption, proposed recently that are secure under our new models."
personal marks and community certificates: detecting clones in wireless mobile social networks,"Barbera MV,Mei A",Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,2012,10.1109/DCOSS.2012.22,"We consider the problem of detecting clones in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. We assume that one of the devices of the network has been cloned. Everything, including saved passwords, certificates and secret keys. We propose a solution in networks of mobile devices carried by individuals -- composedby nodes that can communicate by short-range technology like bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and links appear and disappear according to social relationships between users. Our idea is to use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal smart phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the owner of the device and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks and Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol that works well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the network that tries to use the stolen credentials in the social community of the original device that has been cloned. Community Certificates works well when the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen credentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social network from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an excellent protection against this very strong attack. We prove our ideas and solutions with extensive simulations in both simulated and real world scenarios -- with mobility traces collected in a real life experiment."
certchain: public and efficient certificate audit based on blockchain for tls connections,"Chen J,Yao S,Yuan Q,He K,Ji S,Du R",IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,2018,10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486344,"In recent years, real-world attacks against PKI take place frequently. For example, malicious domains' certificates issued by compromised CAs are widespread, and revoked certificates are still trusted by clients. In spite of a lot of research to improve the security of SSL/TLS connections, there are still some problems unsolved. On one hand, although log-based schemes provided certificate audit service to quickly detect CAs' misbehavior, the security and data consistency of log servers are ignored. On the other hand, revoked certificates checking is neglected due to the incomplete, insecure and inefficient certificate revocation mechanisms. Further, existing revoked certificates checking schemes are centralized which would bring safety bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based public and efficient audit scheme for TLS connections, which is called Certchain. Specially, we propose a dependability-rank based consensus protocol in our blockchain system and a new data structure to support certificate forward traceability. Furthermore, we present a method that utilizes dual counting bloom filter (DCBF) with eliminating false positives to achieve economic space and efficient query for certificate revocation checking. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that CertChain is suitable in practice with moderate overhead."
on the security of a provably secure certificateless strong designated verifier signature scheme based on bilinear pairings,"Lin HY,Ting PY,Yang LF",Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Telecommunications and Communication Engineering,2017,10.1145/3145777.3145784,"A strong designated verifier signature (SDVS) is a variation of traditional digital signatures, since it allows a signer to designate an intended receiver as the verifier rather than anyone. To do this, a signer must incorporate the verifier's public key with the signing procedure such that only the intended receiver could verify this signature with his/her private key. Such a signature further enables a designated verifier to simulate a computationally indistinguishable transcript intended for himself. Consequently, no one can identify the real signer's identity from a candidate signer and a designated verifier, which is referred to as the property of signer ambiguity. A strong notion of signer ambiguity states that no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish the real signer of a given SDVS that is not received by the designated verifier, even if the adversary has obtained the signer's private key. In 2013, Islam and Biswas proposed a provably secure certificateless strong designated verifier signature (CL-SDVS) scheme based on bilinear pairings. In this paper, we will demonstrate that their scheme fails to satisfy strong signer ambiguity and must assume a trusted private key generator (PKG). In other words, their CL-SDVS scheme is vulnerable to both key-compromise and malicious PKG attacks. Additionally, we present an improved variant to eliminate these weaknesses."
a certificateless anonymous authenticated announcement scheme in vehicular ad hoc networks,"Malip A,Ng SL,Li Q",,2014,10.1002/sec.760,"Vehicular ad hoc networks provide a safer driving environment by allowing vehicles to broadcast safety related messages and inform neighbouring vehicles regarding traffic and road conditions. Safety can only be achieved if transmission of messages is reliable. However, verification of reliability may violate privacy. On the other hand, it is desirable that malicious or defective vehicles can be identified and revoked. In this paper, we propose a new protocol by using certificateless signature and reputation system to achieve the sometimes contradictory requirements of a reliable, private and accountable vehicular ad hoc network message announcement scheme.

"authentication and certificate managements of unauthorized intrusion in ad-hoc networks, problems and solutions","Yosaka N,Nishimura I,Nagase T",Proceedings of the 2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems,2011,10.1109/NBiS.2011.108,"The development of today's wireless technology with its sophisticated devices and applications has attracted many users and becoming more important in their daily life. Ad hoc networks have emerged from this technology to provide new services to mobile users. In contrast with conventional wireless networks, ad hoc networks are not connected to any stationary infrastructure. Furthermore, the mobility functions, such as routing, connection's decisions and security managements, are performed by the nodes themselves independently. Therefore, the security problem for mobile ad hoc networks is becoming one of the major issues that need to be solved. The security of ad hoc networks is based on certification authority (CA) which issues and manages security certificates and public keys for message encryption. This paper introduces a new method of detecting unauthorized intrusion that is used by malicious user who issues a forged certificate to join a group of ad hoc network. This method also eliminates unnecessary certificates exchange among users' nodes to reduce traffic flow inside the network."

collaborative validation of public-key certificates for iot by distributed caching,"Wang M,Qian C,Li X,Shi S",IEEE INFOCOM 2019 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,2019,10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737423,"Public-key certificate validation is an important building block for various security protocols for IoT devices, such as secure channel establishment, handshaking, verifying sensing data authenticity from cloud storage, and Blockchains. However, certification validation incurs non-trivial overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, because it either requires long latency or large cache space. This work proposes to utilize the power of distributed caching and explores the feasibility of using the cache spaces on all IoT devices as a large pool to store validated certificates. We design a Collaborative Certificate Validation (CCV) protocol including a memory-efficient and fast locator for certificate holders, a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of devices, and a protocol suite for dynamic update and certificate revocation. Evaluation results show that CCV only uses less than 25% validation time and reduces >90% decryption operations on each device, compared to a recent method. Malicious devices that conduct dishonest validations can be detected by the network using the proposed trust model."
design of provably secure and efficient certificateless blind signature scheme using bilinear pairing,"Islam SK,Obaidat MS",,2015,10.1002/sec.1344,"In the literature, several pairing-based blind signature schemes have been put forwarded using identity-based cryptography. However, the private key escrow problem of these schemes makes them unsuitable in practical environments because the private key generator computes signer private key using signer public identity. Therefore, an untrusted/semitrusted private key generator may perform malicious activity on behalf of the signer. We took the advantage of certificateless public key cryptography and constructed a robust and efficient certificateless blind signature CL-BS scheme using bilinear pairing. Furthermore, the probabilistic map-to-point hash function, which requires more computation time than the execution time of an elliptic curve scalar point multiplication, is circumvented in our scheme. We found that our scheme is unlinkable and provably secure against the adaptive chosen message and identity adversaries. From the perspective of computational costs, our scheme is more efficient and secure than other related schemes. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
certificateless broadcast signcryption with forward secrecy,"Luo M,Zou CH,Xu J",Proceedings of the 2011 Seventh International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security,2011,10.1109/CIS.2011.205,"Certificate less cryptography achieves the best of the two worlds: it inherits from identity-based techniques a solution to the certificate management problem in public-key encryption, whilst removing the secret key escrow functionality inherent to the identity-based setting. Broadcast signcryption, which enables the broadcaster to simultaneously encrypt and sign the content meant for a specific set of users in a single logical step, provides the most efficient solution to this dual problem of confidentiality and authentication. In this paper, we first construct a certificate less broadcast signcryption scheme and show that the proposed scheme is secure against an uncertified user and a malicious trusted authority simultaneously under the Diffie-Hellman assumptions in the random oracle. Moreover, our scheme satisfies register authentication and forward secrecy security attributes. As compared with the recently proposed broadcast signcryption schemes, our scheme has better performance in term of the security and computation overheads."
weaknesses and improvements of an efficient certificateless signature scheme without using bilinear pairings,"Tsai JL,Lo NW,Wu TC",,2014,10.1002/dac.2388,"The certificateless signature CLS scheme is a special signature scheme that solves the key escrow problem in identity-based signature schemes. In CLS schemes, the private key is generated cooperatively by the key generator center KGC and signer, such that a malicious KGC cannot masquerade as the signer and sign a message. He et al. in 2011 proposed an efficient CLS scheme without using bilinear pairings. However, we discovered that the CLS scheme by He et al. cannot resist a strong type 2 adversary if this adversary replaces the master public key of the KGC. This work proposes an improved scheme that overcomes this weakness. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
certificateless threshold signature secure in the standard model,"Xiong H,Li F,Qin Z",,2013,10.1016/j.ins.2010.06.010,"Threshold signature is an extension of the standard signature, in which several signers may be required to cooperatively sign messages for sharing the responsibility and authority. Certificateless cryptography eliminates the need of certificates in the Public Key Infrastructure and solves the inherent key-escrow problem in the Identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. In this paper, we propose a certificateless threshold signature scheme with concrete implementation which is provably secure in the standard model. Furthermore, this scheme is proven secure against the malicious-but-passive KGC attack. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the first construction of certificateless threshold signature scheme that does not rely on random oracle or ideal ciphers."

how is the forged certificates in the wild: practice on large-scale ssl usage measurement and analysis,"Cui M,Cao Z,Xiong G","Computational Science – ICCS 2018: 18th International Conference, Wuxi, China, June 11–13, 2018 Proceedings, Part III",2018,10.1007/978-3-319-93713-7_62,"Forged certificate is a prominent issue in the real world deployment of SSL/TLS - the most widely used encryption protocols for Internet security, which is typically used in man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, proxies, anonymous or malicious services, personal or temporary services, etc. It wrecks the SSL encryption, leading to privacy leakage and severe security risks. In this paper, we study forged certificates in the wild based on a long term large scale passive measurement. With the combination of certificate transparency (CT) logs and our measurement results, nearly 3 million forged certificates against the Alexa Top 10K sites are identified and studied. Our analysis reveals the causes and preference of forged certificates, as well as several significant differences from the benign ones. Finally, we discover several IP addresses used for MITM attacks by forged certificate tracing and deep behavior analysis. We believe our study can definitely contribute to research on SSL/TLS security as well as real world protocol usage."
a secure and efficient certificateless signature scheme for internet of things,"Xiang D,Li X,Gao J,Zhang X",,2022,10.1016/j.adhoc.2021.102702,
certificateless signcryption in the standard model,"Zhou C,Gao G,Cui Z",,2017,10.1007/s11277-016-3554-8,"Signcryption can realize encryption and signature simultaneously with lower computational costs and communicational overheads than those of the traditional sign-then-encrypt approach. Certificateless cryptosystem solves the key escrow problem in the identity-based cryptosystem and simplifies the public key management in the traditional public key cryptosystem. There have been some certificateless signcryption schemes proposed in the standard model up to now, but all of them are just proposed in a weaker Type I security model, which is weaker than the original security model of Barbosa and Farshim, who proposed the first certificateless signcryption scheme. In this paper, we propose a certificateless signcryption scheme in the standard model by using bilinear pairings, which is Type I secure in the original security model of Barbosa and Farshim and can resist the malicious-but-passive key generation center Type II attack. The proposed scheme is proved confidential assuming the modified decisional bilinear Diffie---Hellman (M-DBDH) problem is hard, and unforgeable assuming the square computational Diffie---Hellman (Squ-CDH) problem is hard. At last, we evaluate its efficiency which shows it is of high efficiency."
public key cryptography sans certificates in ad hoc networks,Saxena N,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security,2006,10.1007/11767480_26,"Several researchers have proposed the use of threshold cryptographic model to enable secure communication in ad hoc networks without the need of a trusted center. In this model, the system remains secure even in the presence of a certain threshold t of corrupted/malicious nodes.In this paper, we show how to perform necessary public key operations without node-specific certificates in ad hoc networks. These operations include pair-wise key establishment, signing, and encryption. We achieve this by using Feldman's verifiable polynomial secret sharing (VSS) as a key distribution scheme and treating the secret shares as the private keys. Unlike in the standard public key cryptography, where entities have independent private/public key pairs, in the proposed scheme the private keys are related (they are points on a polynomial of degree t) and each public key can be computed from the public VSS information and node identifier. We show that such related keys can still be securely used for standard signature and encryption operations (using resp. Schnorr signatures and ElGamal encryption) and for pairwise key establishment, as long as there are no more that t collusions/corruptions in the system.The proposed usage of shares as private keys can also be viewed as a threshold-tolerant identity-based cryptosystem under standard (discrete logarithm based) assumptions."
certificateless remote anonymous authentication schemes for wirelessbody area networks,"Liu J,Zhang Z,Chen X,Kwak KS",,2014,10.1109/TPDS.2013.145,"Wireless body area network (WBAN) has been recognized as one of the promising wireless sensor technologies for improving healthcare service, thanks to its capability of seamlessly and continuously exchanging medical information in real time. However, the lack of a clear in-depth defense line in such a new networking paradigm would make its potential users worry about the leakage of their private information, especially to those unauthenticated or even malicious adversaries. In this paper, we present a pair of efficient and light-weight authentication protocols to enable remote WBAN users to anonymously enjoy healthcare service. In particular, our authentication protocols are rooted with a novel certificateless signature (CLS) scheme, which is computational, efficient, and provably secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message attack in the random oracle model. Also, our designs ensure that application or service providers have no privilege to disclose the real identities of users. Even the network manager, which serves as private key generator in the authentication protocols, is prevented from impersonating legitimate users. The performance of our designs is evaluated through both theoretic analysis and experimental simulations, and the comparative studies demonstrate that they outperform the existing schemes in terms of better trade-off between desirable security properties and computational overhead, nicely meeting the needs of WBANs."

certificateless-based anonymous authentication and aggregate signature scheme for vehicular ad hoc networks,"Ye X,Xu G,Cheng X,Li Y,Qin Z,Duan Z",,2021,10.1155/2021/6677137,"Development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has aroused extensive attention in recent years. The IoV requires an efficient communication mode when the application scenarios are complicated. To reduce the verifying time and cut the length of signature, certificateless aggregate signature (CL-AS) is used to achieve improved performance in resource-constrained environments like vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which is able to make it effective in environments constrained by bandwidth and storage. However, in the real application scenarios, messages should be kept untamed, unleashed, and authentic. In addition, most of the proposed schemes tend to be easy to attack by signers or malicious entities which can be called coalition attack. In this paper, we present an improved certificateless-based authentication and aggregate signature scheme, which can properly solve the coalition attack. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only uses pseudonyms in communications to prevent vehicles from revealing their identity but also achieves considerable efficiency compared with state-of-the-art work, certificateless signature (CLS), and CL-AS schemes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that when focused on the existential forgery on adaptive chosen message attack and coalition attack, the proposed schemes can be proved secure. Also, we show that our scheme exceeds existing certification schemes in both computing and communication costs."

clasrm: a lightweight and secure certificateless aggregate signature scheme with revocation mechanism for 5g-enabled vehicular networks,"Wang Z,Wang H,Wang Y,Yang X,De Domenico A",,2022,10.1155/2022/3646960,"The rapid deployment of 5G technology has further strengthened the large-scale interconnection between sensing devices and systems and promoted the rapid development of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. 5G-enabled vehicular networks take advantage of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology to achieve the connection between moving vehicles, between vehicles and infrastructure, and between vehicles and the cloud, which can reduce the possibility of traffic jams and accidents, improve transportation efficiency, and realize automatic driving. Besides, 5G-enabled vehicular networks also provide infotainment services and industry application services. High-strength data transmission, however, will bring a serious burden of resource overhead, and there are hidden dangers of security and privacy in the communication process of vehicular networks. Some current vehicular network authentication schemes adopt public key infrastructure-based (PKI-based) and identity-based authentication methods to achieve conditional privacy preservation. Still, these schemes are too expensive and cannot address the problems of costly certificate management or risky key escrow. Some schemes use computationally complex bilinear pairing operations that result in low efficiency and do not consider the revocation of malicious nodes so that they cannot effectively prevent further malicious attacks. This paper proposes a lightweight certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme with a revocation mechanism suitable for 5G-enabled vehicular networks in response to the above problems. Our proposed scheme uses aggregation signature technology to aggregate multiple signatures into a single short signature, thus reducing communication overhead and storage overhead of road side units (RSUs). Furthermore, our proposed scheme utilizes the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to reduce verification time and computational overhead. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious users from sending invalid signatures to attack, our proposed scheme uses binary search to identify invalid signatures and introduces a cuckoo filter to revoke malicious users to prevent reattack. Finally, formal proof and experimental analysis show that our proposed scheme has greater advantages with respect to security and efficiency compared with the previous schemes."
dcdroid: automated detection of ssl/tls certificate verification vulnerabilities in android apps,"Wang Y,Liu X,Mao W,Wang W",Proceedings of the ACM Turing Celebration Conference - China,2019,10.1145/3321408.3326665,"Current Android applications (apps) often use Security Socket Layer(SSL)/Transport Layer Security(TLS) protocols to transmit users' information, as the implementation of SSL/TLS secures the transmission of sensitive information. However, for various reasons, Android developers fail to properly implement SSL/TLS during the development of an app, resulting in security risks. The improper implementations include trusting all certificates, trusting all domain names, or ignoring certificate verification errors. These improper implementations may result in Man-In-The-Middle(MITM) attacks or phishing attacks. In this work, we are motivated to detect vulnerabilities in implementation of SSL/TLS in Android apps by designing and implementing a tool called DCDroid (Detecting SSL/TLS Certificate verification vulnerabilities in Android apps) with the combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis. We focus on four types of vulnerable schema and locate the potential vulnerable code snippets in apps with static analysis. In dynamic analysis, we prioritize the triggering of User Interface(UI) components based on the results with static analysis to confirm the misuse of SSL/TLS. The dynamic analysis benefits from the static analysis and removes false positives. With DCDroid we analyze 960 apps from Google Play and 1253 apps from 360app. The experimental results show that 457 (20.65%) apps contain potential security risks in the implementation of SSL/TLS. Guided by the static analysis, we further confirm that 248 (11.21%) out of 2213 apps are truly vulnerable to MITM and phishing attacks. By analyzing the categories, ranks and version evolution of these detected vulnerable apps, we find that apps of News&Books are more likely to introduce SSL/TLS risks. We also find that the fix cycle of the risk is very long. We provide suggestions on SSL/TLS certificate verification to Android developers in order to deal with the SSL/TLS certificate verification vulnerabilities."
design of vehicle certification schemes in iov based on blockchain,"Wu J,Jin Z,Li G,Xu Z,Fan C,Zheng Y",,2022,10.1007/s11280-022-01078-3,"Because of a large number of vehicles in Internet of Vehicle(IoV), distributed nodes and complex driving environment, data security and certification speed are easily affected. Blockchain enables different devices that do not trust each other to work together, maintain the general state in the process of information dissemination and sharing, and protect the privacy of devices. However, at present, the speed of vehicle certification in IoV is slow, and the use of idle resources is not considered. To address this problem, this paper provides a blockchain-based vehicle identity verification scheme by using a hybrid identity code verification method to ensure the nodes in the network securely share information. Meanwhile, a task processing algorithm based on time window is proposed to optimize the utilization of idle resources. In addition, the method is evaluated by simulation experiment, and the designed scheme can reduce malicious behavior of a registered vehicle in the network, and can shorten the processing task delay."

adding security concerns to safety critical certification,"Nostro N,Bondavalli A,Silva N",Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops,2014,10.1109/ISSREW.2014.56,"Safety-critical systems represent those systems whose failure may lead to catastrophic consequences on users and environment. Several methods and hazard analysis, and standards in different disciplines, have been defined in order to assure the systems have been designed in compliance with safety requirements. The increasing presence of automatic controlling operation, the massive use of networks to transfer data and information, and the human operations introduce a new security concern in safety-critical systems. Security issues (threats) do not only have direct impact on systems availability, integrity and confidentiality, but they also can influence the safety aspects of the safety critical systems. Today taking into account malicious actions through intrusion into communications and computer control systems become a critical and not negligible step during the design and the assessment of safety-critical systems. The paper describes a general methodology to support the assessment of safety-critical system with respect to security aspects. The methodology is based on a library of security threats. Such threats, identified during the work, have been mapped to the NIST security controls. Then, a preliminary representation of the library in the aerospace domain is shown through some simple example, together with some considerations on the relation between security issues and safety impact as a valuable addition to the safety critical systems certification process."
group-based adaptive result certification mechanism in desktop grids,"Choi S,Buyya R",,2010,10.1016/j.future.2009.05.025,"In Desktop Grids, volunteers (i.e, resource providers) have heterogeneous properties and dynamically join and leave during execution. Moreover, some volunteers may behave erratically or maliciously. Thus, it is important to detect and tolerate erroneous results (i.e., result certification) in order to guarantee reliable execution, considering volatility and heterogeneity in a scheduling procedure. However, existing result certification mechanisms do not adapt to such a dynamic environment. As a result, they undergo high overhead and performance degradation. To solve the problems, we propose a new Group-based Adaptive Result Certification Mechanism (GARCM). GARCM applies different result certification and scheduling algorithms to volunteer groups that are constructed according to their properties such as volunteering service time, availability and credibility."
a collaborative reputation-based vetting model for online certification of businesses,"Al Flasi A,Serhani MA,Barka E",Proceedings of the Second Kuwait Conference on E-Services and e-Systems,2011,10.1145/2107556.2107567,"Many organizations have opted to provide their services on the web to remain competitive and to reach wider market space. The open nature of the Internet and lack of barriers open the door to masqueraders to spoof the identity of service provider, and deals maliciously on his behalf. Therefore, a trust mechanism has to be reliable and robust enough to protect the customer and gain his/her confidence in conducting business transactions on the web. The first step towards conducting business transaction is to acquire a certification from a third party authority. However, this certification can be subject of frauds and attacks. To enforce reliable business certification, we propose in this paper a new collaborative reputation based vetting model for digital certificate acquisition. Our model uses a collaborative reputation based on rating the subject business applying for a certification and the number of transactions conducted with the business as well as the reputation of the raters. In addition, it employs a clustering technique to determine the honesty of raters and to implement a reward-penalty approach. We have evaluated our model using a case study and the obtained results prove that our model is robust enough to ensure a reliable certification of businesses."
