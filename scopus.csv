Cognitive radio is efficient in handling spectrum allocation problem by facilitating the allocation of unlicensed spectrum dynamically to the IoT applications. However, cognitive radio network (CRN) capability of spectrum sensing is highly vulnerable to diversified number of security attacks. Malicious user disturbs the spectrum sensing potential and minimizes its accuracy by launching attacks during the detection of primary signal. In this article, certificateless linkable ring signature-based blockchains (CLRSB) is proposed for securing CRNs by achieving reliable discrimination between trustworthy users through cryptographic keys. It initially transformed the complete set of users such as PUs and SUs into the structure of blocks representing the smart contracts-based traditional public ledger blockchain that gets integrated to form a decentralized network for attaining improvement in efficient spectrum sensing. It adopted a mayfly optimization algorithm (MFOA)-improved CNN (MFOA-ICNN)-based spectrum sensing method for preventing the interference between PUs and SUs during spectrum access. It also used MFOA for optimizing the features with balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation to identify the remarkable features that attributes toward efficient spectrum sensing. It specifically used CLRS for protecting information about the transaction initiator for the objective of protecting blockchain privacy. Simulation experiments of this CLRSB confirmed better response time and minimized frame loss on an average by 18.13% and 17.81%, better than the baseline schemes used for investigation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","blockchain; certificateless linkable ring signature; cognitive radio networks; internet of things; malicious users; spectrum sensing","Authentication; Cognitive radio; Economic and social effects; Internet of things; Radio; Radio systems; Allocation problems; Block-chain; Certificateless; Certificateless linkable ring signature; Cognitive radio network; Linkable ring signatures; Malicious user; Optimization algorithms; Spectrum allocation; Spectrum sensing; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135121935"

HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. Furthermore, we developed a real-time monitoring system using the analysis techniques. We demonstrate its usefulness for the practical security operation. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs. © 2021.

To strategy for overcome the Sybil attack in MANET and improve the efficiency of the Sybil attack detection by enhancing the data confidentiality and reliability. The primary objective of this research work is to develop a scheme to detect and prevent the Sybil attack in the MANET and to provide a highly reliable data transmission approach. The proposed system ensures the availability, confidentiality, authenticity and reliability of the information using digital certificate chains and secret sharing schemes. To detect the sybil node during the route discovery process, the nodes authenticate each other by providing the digital security certificate (DSC). The digital security certificate proves the nodes and allows only authorized node to participate in the route to transmit the data packets from the source to destination. It will not ensure the confidential data transmission when the legitimate node exhibits the malicious behavior in certain circumstances. When any intermediate nodes learn about the data packet that is being transmitted, then the security in data transmission becomes a critical factor. The safety of the network can be enhanced by preventing the sybil attack in MANET by increasing the data confidentiality and reliability. Only certified and authenticated nodes can participate in the route to transfer the data packets between the nodes. To prevent the sybil attack, it is necessary to secure the data that is transmitted over the insecure communication routes. © 2018 Authors.","An authentication process; Attack detection; Digital security certificate; MANET; Route discovery; Sybil attack","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082364523"

Due to the foreseen impact of VANETs, extensive studies in both academia and industry fields has been made, which emphasizes on effective VANETs implementations. In practical VANETs scenarios with open wireless communication characteristics, enhanced security strategies should be deployed in order to guarantee transmission safety. Moreover, individual vehicle needs to perform pre-defined authentication process toward all the acquired messages, some of which may be generated by abnormal devices or malicious attackers. In this case, with large amounts of anomaly messages to be authenticated during a relatively short time period, the denial of service (DoS) attack is possible. Note that the vehicle has limited computation capability and restrained storage. In this paper, we address the above issues by developing a secure and efficient authentication scheme with unsupervised anomaly detection. In our design, certificateless authentication technique is deployed for conditional privacy preserving, along with the Chinese remainder theorem for efficient group key distribution and dynamic updating. Subsequently, the corresponding unsupervised anomaly detection method is illustrated, which applies dynamic time warping for distance measurement. The proposed method could remarkably alleviate unnecessary authentication burden in vehicle side. DoS attack can also be prevented in this way. Furthermore, anomaly detection method is conducted by the involving road side units (RSUs), while the contents of the processing traffic flows are kept secret to RSUs during the entire process. Security analysis shows that our scheme can achieve desired security properties. Additionally, performance analysis demonstrates that our design is efficient compared with state-of-the-art. © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly detection; certificateless authentication; dynamic time warping (DTW); unsupervised learning; Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Authentication; Computation theory; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Network protocols; Unsupervised learning; Vehicles; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly detection; Certificateless; Dynamic time warping; Vehicle dynamics; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Wireless communications; Vehicular ad hoc networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057782314"

Traditional methods to identify the malicious flows in Crossfire attacks are rerouting, which is based on statistics. In these existing mechanisms, the identification of malicious flows depends on the IP address. However, the IP address is easy to be changed by attacks. Compared with the IP address, the certificate is more challenging to be tampered with or forged. Moreover, the traffic trend in the network is towards encryption. The certificates are popularly utilized by IoT devices for authentication in encryption protocols. DTLShps proposed a new way to verify certificates for resource-constrained IoT devices by using the SDN controller. Based on DTLShps, the SDN controller can collect statistics on certificates. In this paper, we propose Certrust, a framework based on the trust of certificates, to mitigate the Crossfire attack by using SDN for IoT. Our goal is threefold. First, the trust model is built based on the Bayesian trust system with the statistics on the participation of certificates in each Crossfire attack. Moreover, the forgetting curve is utilized instead of the traditional decay method in the Bayesian trust system for achieving a moderate decay rate. Second, for detecting the Crossfire attack accurately, a method based on graph connectivity is proposed. Third, several trust-based routing principles are proposed to mitigate the Crossfire attack. These principles can also encourage users to use certificates in communication. The performance evaluation shows that Certrust is more effective in mitigating the Crossfire attack than the traditional rerouting schemes. Moreover, our trust model has a more appropriate decay rate than the traditional methods. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

As a promising Android malware detection scheme, we focus on the scheme leveraging the differences of traffic patterns between benign apps and malware. Those differences can be captured even if the packet is encrypted. However, since such features are just statistic based ones, they cannot identify whether each traffic is malicious. Thus, it is necessary to design the scheme which is applicable to encrypted traffic data and supports identification of malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection scheme based on the level of SSL server certificate. Attackers tend to use an untrusted certificate to encrypt malicious payloads in many cases because passing rigorous examination is required to get a trusted certificate. Thus, we utilize SSL server certificate based features for detection since their certificates tend to be untrusted. Furthermore, in order to obtain the more exact features, we introduce required permission based weight values because malware inevitably require permissions regarding malicious actions. By computer simulation with real dataset, we show our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.7 %.

Data communication between two or more parties using certificate authentication is a frequently employed security assurance approach that creates a substantial quantity of certificate data traffic. In the process of utilizing conventional certificates, it is possible to leak sensitive information of the corporation. For example, certificate data traffic in the smart grid may expose important nodes and current security management level of a certain grid-related network. Therefore, a solution is required to evaluate the data of the grid-related network at the certificate level in a secure and efficient manner. This study provides a certificate-based enterprise privacy analysis and anomaly detection scheme. Using SSL/TLS and X.509 as standards, the scheme extracts valid certificate information by collecting certificate data traffic between enterprise networks and analyzing the certificate data. The scheme monitors and analyzes the flow of certificate data for the grid network, identifies suspicious anomalous behaviors and invalid certificates, and warns of risky behavior. By monitoring certificate data flow, it is feasible to improve the enterprise authentication framework and business communication method, prevent the leaking of enterprise privacy data. © 2022 IEEE.","certificate; privacy analysis; SSL/ TLS; X.509","Anomaly detection; Network security; Sensitive data; Business collaboration; Certificate; Certificate-based; Data traffic; Data-communication; Globalisation; Privacy analysis; Security assurance; SSL/TLS; X.509; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168102493"

It is vital to secure MANET exchanges to ensure the network's services development. In this research, the proposed model focuses on providing trust and certificate-based Malicious Node detection for mobile adhoc networks and improving certificate revocation based on cluster head. The cluster head is crucial in eliminating falsely accused nodes. The malicious node may be easily discovered and isolated from the network using the trusted value. If the trust value falls below the trust threshold value in a trust management, the node is identified as malicious, the certificate is canceled, and the node is isolated from the network. The TSQRS protocol's integration with the CRS scheme was the main emphasis of the suggested model. The proposed model also creates more stable clusters with the help of Trust manager. When compared to other current protocols and methodologies, the findings produced by the suggested approach for the TSQRS-CRS scheme improve performance and stability in the QoS of MANETs.

Certificate Transparency (CT) aims at increasing the visibility of such malicious actions by requiring certificate authorities (CAs) to log every certificate they issue in public, tamper-proof, append-only logs. This work introduces Phish-Hook, a novel approach towards detecting phishing websites based on machine learning. Phish-Hook analyses certificates submitted to the CT system based on a conceptually simple, well-understood classification mechanism to effectively attest the phishing likelihood of newly issued certificates. Phish-Hook relies solely on CT log data and foregoes intricate analyses of websites’ source code and traffic. As a consequence, we are able to provide classification results in near real-time and in a resource-efficient way. Our approach advances the state of the art by classifying websites according to five different incremental certificate risk labels, instead of assigning a binary label.

The basic requirement for ad hoc network is to provide security. For providing authentication (trust) to the nodes, secure routing is the primary challenge. For improving the security, the most important thing is to examine the trustworthiness of nodes or mobile devices by identifying selfish and malicious nodes in the network. We are using the concept of trust and applying it on popular routing protocols of MANETs like DSR and AODV for providing secure routing. And also we are using the following algorithms, calculation of trust value (level) algorithm, identification of node misbehavior and modification of trust value algorithm, certificate distribution algorithm, and route innovation and maintenance algorithm for all the nodes in the network. Now, our concept of certificate-based trust and algorithms deals with the malicious nodes and provides a high secure routing. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","MANET; NS-2; Security; Selfish nodes","Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Centralized control; Certificate-based; Distribution algorithms; Maintenance algorithms; Malicious nodes; Node misbehavior; Self configuration; Self maintenance; Mobile ad hoc networks","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049534069"

However, encryption also allows cybercriminals to hide their messages and carry out successful malware attacks while avoiding detection. Further aiding criminals is the fact that web browsers display a green lock symbol in the URL bar when a connection to a website is encrypted. This symbol gives a false sense of security to users, who are in turn more likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. The risk of encrypted traffic means that information security researchers must explore new techniques to detect, classify, and take countermeasures against malicious traffic. So far there exists no approach for TLS detection in the wild. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying malicious use of web certificates using deep neural networks. Our system uses the content of TLS certificates to successfully identify legitimate certificates as well as malicious patterns used by attackers. The results show that our system is capable of identifying malware certificates with an accuracy of 94.87% and phishing certificates with an accuracy of 88.64%.

This i motivated by phishing domains that have started to abuse the (erroneous) trust of the public in browser padloc symbols, and by the large-scale adoption of the Certificate Transparency (CT) framework. This publicl accessible evidence trail of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates has made the TLS landscape mor transparent than ever. By comparing samples of phishing, popular benign, and non-popular benign domains we provide insight into the TLS certificates issuance behavior for phishing domains, focusing on the selectio of the certificate authority, the validation level of the certificates, and the phenomenon of certificate sharin among phishing domains. Our results show that phishing domains gravitate to a relatively small selection o certificate authorities, and disproportionally to cPanel, and tend to rely on certificates with a low, and cheap validation level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the vast majority of certificates issued for phishing domain cover more than only phishing domains. These results suggest that a more pro-active role of CAs and puttin more emphasis on certificate revocation can have a crucial impact in the defense against phishing attacks.

Therefore, research on such networks should evolve to take the final step and move from theory to reality. However, first, it is necessary to improve many aspects related to security. In particular, identification and management of malicious users within the network are major research issues.

The former reconstructs a LiDAR scan with state estimations, and excludes the possible faulty estimations that are not aligned with LiDAR measurements. We also verify the correctness of LiDAR scans by comparing them with the reconstructed ones and removing the possibly compromised sector in the scan. Fault tolerant control computes a control signal with the remaining estimations at each time step.

In contrast to previous works that consider this a binary classification problem, we take into account that a certificate can be partially benign and phishy simultaneously. We propose a multi-class classifier and a regressor to classify these ambiguous certificates, in addition to benign and phishing certificates, where the 'phishyness' of a certificate is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 for the regressor.

Here certificate authority Scheme (CAS) is responsible for the issue of the certificates for these nodes. The CAS maintains two sets of lists - a warning list and a blocked list. The node is added to a warning list if any of the neighbor nodes raises a suspension about a node. Both the accuser and the accused are added to this list. The node is transferred to blocked list when the corruption in the node is confirmed. A node from the blocked list is never added to the network again. This process is termed as cluster-based certificate revocation scheme (CBCRS). The priority of this technique is not the detection of the corrupted node but the removal of the corrupted node from the network. Experimental results reveal that this protocol is free from vulnerabilities. © 2016 Authors.","Certificate authority scheme (CAS); Cluster-based certificate revocation scheme (CBCRS); Fixed infrastructure; Malicious avoidance certificate revocation; Mobile Ad-hoc networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082371817"

The widely used encryption transmission protocols, such as the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols, leads to the failure of traditional payload-based classification methods. Existing methods for encrypted traffic classification suffer from low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a certificate-aware encrypted traffic classification method based on the Second-Order Markov Chain. We start by exploring reasons why existing methods not perform well, and make a novel observation that certificate packet length in SSL/TLS sessions contributes to application discrimination. To increase the diversity of application fingerprints, we develop a new model by incorporating the certificate packet length clustering into the Second-Order homogeneous Markov chains.

Existing authentication protocols are vulnerable to some problems, such as a high computational overhead with certificate distribution and revocation, strong reliance on tamper-proof devices, limited scalability when building many secure channels, and an inability to detect hardware tampering attacks. In this paper, an improved authentication scheme using certificateless public key cryptography is proposed to address these problems. A security analysis of our scheme shows that our protocol provides an enhanced secure anonymous authentication, which is resilient against major security threats. Furthermore, the proposed scheme reduces the incidence of node compromise and replication attacks. The scheme also provides a malicious-node detection and warning mechanism, which can quickly identify compromised static nodes and immediately alert the administrative department. With performance evaluations, the scheme can obtain better trade-offs between security and efficiency than the well-known available schemes. © 2018 by the authors.","Authentication; Certificateless; Identity-based; Vehicular sensor network (VSN)","Authentication; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Economic and social effects; Public key cryptography; Security systems; Sensor networks; Anonymous authentication; Certificateless; Certificateless public key cryptography; Identity-based; Intelligent traffic systems; Malicious node detections; Public key authentication; Vehicular sensor network; Network security","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040782388"

In general, phishers frequently reassign resources, such as domain names and IP addresses, to avoid detection. Consequently, multiple domains may be hosted by the same IP address, or vice versa. Furthermore, phishing websites often employ certificates and HTTPS encryption to appear more trustworthy. In this study, we focused on HTTPS-enabled phishing websites to construct and analyze DNS graphs of domain names and IP addresses of phishing websites using Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. From the analysis results, we examined the differences between benign and phishing websites in terms of the number of nodes per component and average node degree. © 2023 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).","DNS; DNS Graph; Phishing; Security","Computer crime; HTTP; Internet protocols; Websites; Average node degrees; Digital certificates; DNS; DNS graph; Domain names; Multiple domains; Phishers; Phishing; Phishing websites; Security; Cryptography","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152187284"

It takes a vital role in safety fields such as defense system, traffic system, etc. Even though, some advanced Public Key Infrastructure and digital signature method was used for security, intrusion detection is an inevitable challenge in networks. Prevention and detection of malicious vehicle from jeopardizing the safety of the other vehicle is focused in this paper by using region-based FBB (Flooding-Bilinear-Bloom Filter) authentication protocol. Authentication is performed in any PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) system by checking if the certificate of the sender is included in the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) and verifying the authenticity and checking the sign of the sender. Bilinear pairing method is used to create an anonymous Id for each vehicle. The CRL checking process has been done using Bloom Filter method which avoids false negative. CRL can be passed between vehicles by bidirectional flooding method which avoids network congestion. This paper focuses mainly the CRL dissemination using the bi-directional flooding method. It replaces the time-consuming CRL Checking process. It reduces message loss ratio by using fast revocation checking and CRL updating method as well as it needs very less memory space compared to other methods. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Certificate Revocation List; Roadmap Distance Protocol; Secret Key; Security; Vanet","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937951477"

Vehicular networks are the subset of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET). Each and every vehicle is considered as a node. One node can directly communicate with another node within its transmission range. When the nodes communicate, there is a chance of malicious attackers to intr ude and degrade the performance of the entire vehicular network. Malicious node detection is a vital security issue for safety-related applications. The malicious vehicle should be detected and revoked to the smooth functioning of the vehicular communication system.

A defense technique such as certificate revocation is devised to eradicate and provide protection against the malicious nodes that behaves like a legitimate node.

Basically, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a security problem emanating from attacks. When handling packet forwarding, several types of availability as well as integrity attacks exist, including fabrication, modification, misrouting and dropping whether full or partial. This research utilizes the Secure Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR mechanism which includes certificate authorized nodes (CAs) and RSA algorithm to enhance the security and provide secure routing for OLSR routing protocol, through detection of malicious nodes that perform black hole attack. The proposed protocol is called (SOLS) mechanism. The aim of using the RSA algorithm with certificate authorized nodes (CAs) is to find the secure path from the source to the destination and to detect the black hole attack. We have evaluated the performance of SOLS mechanism by designing simulation using MATLAB. We have compared our mechanism with the performance of protocol OLSR and Baadachi’s approach. The comparison was conducted based on the detection ratio, packet delivery ratio, routing overhead, total network load, average delay and source traffic sent & destination traffic received. The SOLS outperformed the Baadachi’s approach under wide network performance metrics and settings. The SOLS improved the detection ratio by 4% compared to Baadachi’s approach; the implication of this finding is that SOLS can be applied to MANET to detect black hole attack. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

We show that its efficacy extends beyond HTTPSenabled sites. Our solution enables immediate local identification of phishing sites. As such, this serves as an important complement to the existing server-based anti-phishing mechanisms which predominately use blacklists. Blacklisting suffers from several inherent drawbacks in terms of correctness, timeliness, and completeness. Due to the potentially significant lag prior to site blacklisting, there is a window of opportunity for attackers. Other local client-side phishing detection approaches also exist, but primarily rely on page content or URLs, which are arguably easier to manipulate by attackers. We illustrate that our certificatebased approach greatly increases the difficulty of masquerading undetected for phishers, with single millisecond delays for users. We further show that this approach works not only against HTTPS-enabled phishing attacks, but also detects HTTP phishing attacks with port 443 enabled. © 2015 IEEE.","certificates; machine learning; security","Crime; Learning systems; Locks (fasteners); Machine learning; Signal detection; Websites; Certificate-based; certificates; Machine learning approaches; Phishing detections; Phishing websites; Public key certificates; Real-time detection; security; Computer crime","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937899280"

Since IoT data are vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, forgery, and other attacks during an open network transmission, the integrity and authenticity of data are fundamental security requirements in the IoT. A certificateless signature (CLS) is a viable solution for providing data integrity, data authenticity, and identity identification in resource-constrained IoT devices. Therefore, designing a secure and efficient CLS scheme for IoT environments has become one of the main objectives of IoT security research. However, the existing CLS schemes rarely focus on strong unforgeability and replay attacks. Herein, we design a novel CLS scheme to protect the integrity and authenticity of IoT data. In addition to satisfying the strong unforgeability requirement, the proposed scheme also resists public key replacement attacks, malicious-but-passive key-generation-centre attacks, and replay attacks. Compared with other related CLS schemes without random oracles, our CLS scheme has a shorter private key, stronger security, and lower communication and computational costs. © 2019 by the authors.

Because people trust in encryption technology, a series of attack methods based on certificates have been de-rived. Malicious certificates protect many malicious behaviors and threaten data security. To counter this threat, machine learning algorithms are widely used in malicious certificate detection. However, the detection efficiency of such algorithms largely depends on whether the extracted features can effectively represent the data. In contrast, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can automatically extract useful features. GCNs are powerful at fitting graph data, which can improve the effectiveness of learning systems by efficiently embedding prior knowledge in an end-to-end manner. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for detecting malicious digital certificates with GCNs. Firstly, we transform the digital certificate dataset with pem document structure into a corpus of graph structure based on attribute co-occurrence and document attribute relations. Then, we put the graph structure certificate dataset into a GCN for training. The results of the experiment show that GCN is very effective in certificate classification and outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and extant neural network algorithms. The accuracy of our algorithm to detect malicious certificates is 97.41%. This shows that our algorithm is very effective. © 2022 by the authors.

As a promising Android malware detection scheme, we focus on the scheme leveraging the differences of traffic patterns between benign apps and malwares. Those differences can be captured even if the packet is encrypted. However, since such features are just statistic based ones, they cannot identify whether each traffic is malicious. Thus, it is necessary to design the scheme which is applicable to encrypted traffic data and supports identification of malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection scheme based on level of SSL server certificate. Attackers tend to use an untrusted certificate to encrypt malicious payloads in many cases because passing rigorous examination is required to get a trusted certificate. Thus, we utilize SSL server certificate based features for detection since their certificates tend to be untrusted. Furthermore, in order to obtain the more exact features, we introduce required permission based weight values because malwares inevitably require permissions regarding malicious actions. By computer simulation with real dataset, we show our scheme achieves an accuracy of 92.7%. True positive rate and false positive rate are 5.6% higher and 3.2% lower than the previous scheme, respectively.

The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites with low false positives and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs. © 2020 IEEE.","HTTPS; Phishing; Public-Key Certificate","Computer crime; HTTP; Certificate authority; Clustering analysis; Comprehensive monitoring; Conventional detection; Domain registrations; Potential benefits; Public key certificates; Research questions; Websites","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097053831"

The main aim of this paper is to provide security in the network. In this paper, we propose Trust and certificate based Malicious Node detection and also enhanced cluster based certificate revocation based on cluster head scheme. Cluster head plays an important role in detecting falsely accused nodes. The reliability will be increased based on single node accusation and based on the optimum threshold value the malicious node can be identified easily and it can be isolate from the network. Instead of nodes directly send accusation message to Certificate Authority (CA), it will confirm with Cluster Head then Cluster Head will make a decision for accusation. Then Cluster Head pass the message to CA. In the trust based scheme, if the trust value falls below the threshold value, then malicious node can be isolated from the network. The performance of our scheme is measured by simulation method. © Research India Publications.","Certificate authority; Certificate revocation; Cluster head; Mobile adhoc networks (MANETs); Trust handler; Trust table","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942429028"
